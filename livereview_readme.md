# LiveReview: Blast-Radius Aware AI Code Review for Business-Critical Systems

LiveReview is an AI code reviewer that scores every hunk of a diff by **blast radius**: how far a change reaches through your call graph, how much persistent state it touches, and how well-tested it is. A 3-line change to a shared auth check can outrank a 300-line UI tweak. Your team's attention goes to the highest-risk code first, not spread evenly across every diff.

<details>
<summary>How does Blast Radius scoring work? (a more technical explanation)</summary>

**Here's the goal:**

- A 3-line fix in a function used by 40 other files, that also writes to a database, should score high.
- A 300-line UI change in one file, fully covered by tests and used by nothing else, should score low, even though it's the bigger diff.

To get there, LiveReview gives each hunk two scores, then combines them into one and ranks every hunk in the diff by it.

- **Blast Radius**: how far a change can reach through your code.
  - How many other places call this code, directly or a few steps removed
  - Whether it writes to a database or other long-term storage
  - Whether those callers live in other parts of the codebase, not just nearby files
- **Review Priority**: how much scrutiny a change warrants, based on its complexity, subtlety, and potential for important details to be missed.
  - How many different paths the logic can take, and how hard it is to follow
  - How deeply loops sit nested inside other loops
  - How many other functions or symbols this code itself calls into
  - Whether the code has tests

LiveReview may add new signals over time. The two questions behind them stay the same: how far, and how much scrutiny.

## The System: LiveReview Is an Independent Inspection Layer

LiveReview runs as an independent inspection layer on top of whatever writes your code: Claude, Copilot, Cursor, or anything else. AI can generate code far faster than any human can review it by hand — the leverage comes from an inspection layer that runs at the same speed AI writes, not from slowing the writing down. That independence is what turns engineering competence into business leverage: fewer regressions, less downtime, and fewer quality, performance, and security surprises.

LiveReview organizes around five capabilities, each answering a question your team already asks. **Improve feeds straight back into Review**: the loop below runs continuously on every commit, not once at setup.

| Pillar                           | Question it answers                                                        | What it covers                                                                                                |

## Review: Get Both Speed and Quality

Some tools give you speed and sacrifice quality, or the reverse. Multi-level review checkpoints let you set policy per team and repo, at different gradations, so you get both.

<a id="org-wide-harness"></a>

### Org-Wide Harness: Enforce Your Standards on Every Line of AI-Generated Code

AI writes code faster than any human can review it by hand. LiveReview gives you a checkpoint at every stage where that code could reach production. Turn on the stages that matter to you, per repository.

| Stage                | What happens                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Commit**           | `git lrc review` checks your staged changes before the commit happens, right in your terminal. No context switch.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Before Push**      | LiveReview catches issues one last time before code leaves your machine. Skips are explicit (`git lrc review --skip`) and stay in the git log, so nothing slips through silently.                                                                                                                            |
| **MR / PR**          | LiveReview posts a full AI review as comments on the pull or merge request. Every hunk gets a Blast Radius and Review Priority score. Works across GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Gitea, and Azure DevOps.                                                                                                       |
| **CI / CD**          | In production deployments, a webhook triggers a review on every push, and [CI/CD Gates](#cicd-gates) (a jq rule you write) decide whether that review result blocks the merge or lets it through.                                                                                                            |
| **Scheduled Checks** | Periodic sweeps scan your repositories for drift and new hotspots, even in code nobody has touched recently. See [Scheduled Reviews](#scheduled-reviews) below, or watch it in action: [Automatically Review Your Production Code with Scheduled Reviews](https://hexmos.com/livereview/demo?v=45EfHmXe_Dw). |

### Pick the Right Review Depth Based on Your Need for Shipping Speed

Not every repo needs the same amount of scrutiny. Turn on more checkpoints where the blast radius of a bad change is high, and fewer where speed matters most.

<p align="center">
   <img src="./assets/screenshots/2026-08-29/16-review-depth-quadrant.png" alt="Quadrant chart: shipping speed vs. review depth for four checkpoint combinations" width="70%"/>
</p>

- **Commit Only**: fastest, lightest net. Fine for low-stakes, throwaway repos.
- **Commit + Scheduled**: the startup pick. Near-zero friction day-to-day, plus a daily sweep that catches anything that slipped past commit-time checks.
- **Commit + Before Push + MR/PR**: the standard team flow. A human sees every change before it merges.
- **All Five (Full Harness)**: Commit, Before Push, MR/PR, CI/CD, and Scheduled together, for repos where a bad change is expensive: payments, auth, core infra.

There's no single right answer, only the right trade-off for a given repository, team, or organization. Mix and match per repository, and change your mind any time.

### Adaptive Reviews: Cut AI Review Costs by 50% Without Compromising Quality

**Adaptive Reviews** uses two AI models instead of one: a powerful Leader Model finds complex issues, and a cost-efficient Helper Model explains them. Same review quality, at half the price.

|                                  |                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reduce Costs by 40-50%**       | A cost-efficient Helper Model writes the explanations, instead of one expensive model doing everything.    |
| **Double Review Volume**         | Review up to 2x more code on the same budget. No need to monitor limits constantly.                        |
| **Leader + Helper Architecture** | The Leader Model finds complex issues. The Helper Model expands those findings into detailed explanations. |
| **Maintain Review Quality**      | The high-end Leader Model still drives issue detection, so accuracy does not drop.                         |

## Understand: Keep Engineers in Touch With What Changed

Keep the business under your team's intellectual control, even as generative AI writes more of the code. AI can write a diff faster than anyone can read it — the goal here is real understanding that doesn't cost time or energy.

<a id="cognitive-coverage"></a>

### Cognitive Coverage via PR Quizzes

AI can write a diff faster than you can read it. **LiveReview quizzes you on the PR before it gets committed**, so you stay in touch with the technical decisions baked into your codebase, instead of rubber-stamping code you never really understood.

- **Auto-generated from the diff**: questions come straight from the actual changes, no manual quiz writing.
- **Quick, before commit**: takes less than a minute, and runs before the diff gets committed, not after.
- **Slides, text, or quiz mode**: pick the format that fits how you like to review.

Cognitive Coverage is the same idea as [Blast-Radius scoring](#the-system) applied to people instead of code: know exactly how much of a change a human actually understood, not just whether an AI reviewed it.

#### Customize Review Prompts to Fit Your Team

Custom Prompts apply org-wide, to every repo LiveReview reviews, so keep them to the handful of standards that really are universal across your org. _(Premium & Enterprise)_ For anything specific to one repo, use [Repository Rules](#repository-rules) instead — most teams should start there. Watch [Customize AI Review Prompts for Your Team](https://hexmos.com/livereview/demo?v=PA0hQWo_6nE), or read [Customize LiveReview to Your Team's Best Practices](https://hexmos.com/livereview/docs/livereview/self-hosted/customize-livereview-to-your-teams-best-practices/).

</p>

#### Discuss with AI in MR and See it Learn Everyday

Every discussion in a merge request becomes a stored "learning": a best practice, a recurring issue, or a team convention the AI applies to every future review. See it in [Improve Reviews with Organizational Learning](https://hexmos.com/livereview/demo?v=t78Fajj74ZI).

</p>

#### Sharp AI-Generated Pull Request Summaries

Every pull request gets a summary of what changed, why it matters, and what risks were flagged, so reviewers don't have to read the whole diff to know where to look. See [Ask Questions About Code via Inline PR Comments](https://hexmos.com/livereview/demo?v=7BtjZ3VS8Mo).

</p>

#### Ask AI for Clarification or Debate Code Changes

Reply to any AI comment in the merge request to ask why it flagged something, or push back on it. The AI has the full diff context, not just the one line it commented on. Watch [Reply to AI Review Comments and Get Guidance](https://hexmos.com/livereview/demo?v=FX9nfubMh68), and [Auto-Fix Review Issues with Claude Code or AI Agents](https://hexmos.com/livereview/demo?v=DV2qt28TMmo).

#### Scheduled Reviews: A Safety Net for the Code Nobody Reviewed

Not every change goes through a full review:

- A hotfix might land straight on the main branch.
- A dependency bump might merge on its own.

For a small, fast-moving team, that's often the right call, you can't review every line by hand and still ship fast. **Scheduled Reviews** are the safety net for exactly that gap.

- **Checks on its own schedule.** LiveReview reviews your default branch even when nobody asked it to, and catches anything that got in outside your normal commit, push, or PR checks.
- **Per-repository control.** Turn it on with one toggle.
- **Your own cadence.** Pick how often it runs, in plain cron syntax, or leave it blank and LiveReview checks once a day.
- **Always visible.** See the last time it ran and the next time it will, right in the schedule list.
- **Zero upkeep.** Runs by itself in the background, nobody has to remember to trigger it.

> For most teams, once a day on the main branch is enough to keep quality high without slowing anyone down.

## Enforce: Turn Standards Into Things That Actually Happen

Aspirations are easy to set. Real transformation lives in the depth and precision of implementation. LiveReview enforces and monitors at that level, so standards get lived, not just stated.

<a id="repository-rules"></a>

### Enforce Your Team's Engineering Standards with Repository Rules

A good reviewer knows your language and framework. A great reviewer also knows _your_ repository: which patterns your team prefers, which dependencies are off-limits, and which files don't need a second look. Drop a `.lrc/` directory in your repo, and LiveReview reads it on every review.

This is per-repo, and stacks on top of any org-wide [Custom Prompts](#features) — reach for Repository Rules first; it's how most teams should scope their standards, since each team keeps its own rules without affecting anyone else's repo.

```
.lrc/
├── ignore               # files the reviewer never sees
├── rules/
│   ├── INSTRUCTIONS.md  # read first, every review
│   ├── security.md
│   └── style.md
└── policy/
    └── tools.toml       # which checks are allowed to run
```

|                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Repository Rules**              | Write down the decisions that come up in every review, such as "prefer direct SQL over ORM abstractions" or "avoid new infrastructure dependencies". LiveReview reads `INSTRUCTIONS.md` first, then every other `rules/*.md` file, in order. |
| **Ignore File**                   | Point the reviewer away from generated code, vendored dependencies, and anything else that doesn't need a second look. Uses gitignore syntax, matched from your repo root. Ignored files don't count toward billable lines.                  |
| **Policies** _(coming soon)_      | Decide which tools and checks can run on this repo. Machine-readable settings that LiveReview reads directly. Never sent to the AI model.                                                                                                    |
| **Static Checks** _(coming soon)_ | Pair AI review with static analyzers like semgrep and eslint. Authorized through policy, run as part of the same commit-time flow.                                                                                                           |

### CI/CD Gates: Precise, Customized Merge Enforcement

A generic "fail if severity is high" checkbox can't match how your team actually thinks about risk. **CI/CD Gates** let you write the exact condition, in [jq](https://jqlang.org/), against the real findings from a LiveReview review, and wire it into any pipeline as a single HTTP call. The pipeline doesn't run an AI model or interpret anything; it reads one URL's HTTP status.

<p align="center">
   <img src="./assets/screenshots/ci-cd-gates/ruleset-list.png" alt="CI/CD Gates: a list of named rulesets, each with its own jq expression" width="85%"/>
</p>

- **Works on any review source.** Web UI, `git-lrc` local reviews, CI/CD-triggered reviews, and API/MCP-triggered reviews all produce the same canonical findings document, so one gate covers every path code takes toward a merge.
- **Full power of jq, no lock-in to preset severity buckets.** Combine severity, category, subcategory, and confidence however your repo actually needs it, not just "block on critical."
- **A live expression editor**, with LLM help. Run your jq against a synthetic sample document and real past reviews as you type, see a `BLOCK`/`ALLOW` verdict update live, and reach for an "Ask LLM" helper (a ready-made prompt with your org's taxonomy and a sample document, for you to paste into ChatGPT, Gemini, or DeepSeek) when the condition gets complex.

<p align="center">
   <img src="./assets/screenshots/ci-cd-gates/jq-editor.png" alt="Live jq rule editor with presets, Ask LLM helper, and a live BLOCK/ALLOW preview against a sample review" width="85%"/>
</p>

Once a ruleset is saved, `GET /ci-rulesets/:id/evaluate` is the whole integration: call it from GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Bitbucket Pipelines, Azure Pipelines, or any generic runner, and gate the job on its HTTP status.

#### Write the rule that matches how your team actually weighs risk

Different teams weigh the same findings differently. jq lets each team encode its own answer, not a preset severity bucket:

|                   | Security-conscious team                                                                  | Fast-moving startup                                                                                                                                                                | Mature enterprise                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cares about**   | Even one security finding is unacceptable, and so is any critical-severity bug elsewhere | Ship velocity matters most: block only on correctness and UX bugs that would actually hurt users or slow the team down, let architecture/style debt through for now                | Security is non-negotiable, but cost, scale, and architecture decisions matter just as much once you're operating at scale                                                              |
| **Plain English** | Block if there's any security finding, or any critical-severity finding of any kind      | Block only if there's a critical or warning-level finding in correctness, UX, or developer-experience                                                                              | Block on any security finding, or on a critical finding in cost, architecture, or scalability                                                                                           |
| **jq expression** | `(.counts.by_category.security > 0) or (.counts.by_severity.critical > 0)`               | `[.findings[] \| select((.category=="correctness" or .category=="ui-ux" or .category=="developer-experience") and (.severity=="critical" or .severity=="warning"))] \| length > 0` | `(.counts.by_category.security > 0) or ([.findings[] \| select((.category=="cost" or .category=="architecture" or .category=="scalability") and .severity=="critical")] \| length > 0)` |

Every category above (`security`, `correctness`, `ui-ux`, `developer-experience`, `cost`, `architecture`, `scalability`, and more) comes from the same [10-category, 100+ risk taxonomy](#impact-report) LiveReview already tracks on every review; the gate is just a rule over data you're already generating.

### Data-Backed Decisions: An AI Chatbot for Your Engineering Data

Ask **Livi** a product, engineering, or ops question in plain English. Livi answers with a chart pulled straight from your organization's own data. No dashboards to build, no SQL to write.

> Every engineering decision becomes more data-backed, so you can act with confidence instead of guesswork.

The same 7 categories also power a one-click **Onboarding Report**, exportable as HTML or PDF, with real charts pulled from your own review history:

<p align="center">

## Connect: Adopt LiveReview Without Disrupting Your Team

None of the above requires disruption. LiveReview works with the tools and systems you already run, so these outcomes are low-friction to reach, not a rebuild.

<a id="mcp-server"></a>

### Get Actionable Engineering Intelligence with MCP and the REST API

Every code review LiveReview performs adds to a growing source of **engineering intelligence**. LiveReview exposes this two separate ways, for two separate purposes:

- **MCP Server** — for AI assistants and agents (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf) that need to ask questions and take action conversationally.
- **REST API** — for scripts, CI/CD pipelines, and custom integrations that need direct HTTP calls with no AI agent in the loop.

Both let you:

- Generate custom reports
- Identify your strongest contributors
- Uncover quality and security trends
- Drill into engineering activity in minutes, not hours

Real use cases from teams already doing this: [Prevent Production Issues](https://hexmos.com/livereview/docs/livereview/mcp/usecases/prevent-production-issues/), [Turn Findings into Tickets](https://hexmos.com/livereview/docs/livereview/mcp/usecases/turn-findings-into-tickets/), [Keep Project Management in Sync](https://hexmos.com/livereview/docs/livereview/mcp/usecases/keep-project-management-in-sync/), and [Generate Release Notes](https://hexmos.com/livereview/docs/livereview/mcp/usecases/generate-release-notes/) — see the [full MCP use-case list](https://hexmos.com/livereview/docs/livereview/mcp/usecases/).

#### Getting your API Key

The same key authenticates both the MCP server and the REST API.

1. Go to LiveReview
2. Click on Settings
3. Navigate to API Keys
4. Generate and copy a new API key

<p align="center">
   <img src="./assets/screenshots/2026-08-29/15-api-keys-slash-settings-api-keys.png" alt="Settings > API Keys: generate and manage keys for the lrc CLI and MCP server" width="80%"/>
</p>

Watch [Create and Manage API Keys](https://hexmos.com/livereview/demo?v=kW_Fhx4AJfk).

#### MCP Server

For AI assistants and agents: Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or anything else that speaks MCP.

##### Configuration

Add the following block to your MCP client's configuration file:

- For eg: Claude Desktop: claude_desktop_config.json
- Other clients: Check the client's documentation for the equivalent file.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "livereview": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://livereview.hexmos.com/api/mcp",
        "--header",
        "X-API-KEY: ${LIVEREVIEW_API_KEY}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "LIVEREVIEW_API_KEY": "<YOUR_LIVEREVIEW_API_KEY>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `<YOUR_LIVEREVIEW_API_KEY>` with your actual LiveReview API key. See the [MCP Configuration docs](https://hexmos.com/livereview/docs/livereview/mcp/mcp-configuration/), or watch [Connect LiveReview MCP Server to AI Coding Assistants](https://hexmos.com/livereview/demo?v=sUTU0qS73_4).

Running an AI agent in your CI/CD pipeline instead of a chat assistant? The MCP server works there too: [Automate Code Reviews in CI/CD with LiveReview MCP](https://hexmos.com/livereview/demo?v=ar4B6IrDrqk).

##### What you can do

Once connected to the MCP server, you can ask your assistant to interact with LiveReview. Each MCP tool below wraps one REST API endpoint (its name follows the endpoint's method and path), but the tool itself is only reachable through the MCP server, not by calling the endpoint directly.

#### REST API

For scripts, CI/CD pipelines, and custom integrations that call LiveReview directly over HTTP, with no AI agent or MCP client involved. Same API key as above, sent as the `X-API-KEY` header. Covers reviews, reports, learnings, billing, connectors, and more.

Full REST API reference: [hexmos.com/livereview/docs/livereview/api](https://hexmos.com/livereview/docs/livereview/api/)

<a id="cli"></a>

### Two CLI Tools. One LiveReview Backend.

Install `git-lrc` for commit-time reviews in any terminal. Use `claude-lrc` when you build inside Claude Code. Both tools share the same AI review engine and the same monthly LOC quota.

```bash
# Typical Git Guardrails Flow
git add .
git lrc review

# Or skip explicitly (auditable in git log):
git lrc review --skip
git commit -m "message"
```

**`git-lrc` (git commit hook):**

- Git-native, works in any repo without a cloud platform connection
- Skips tracked in git log, auditable, not silent
- One-line install, 30k LOC free every month

**`claude-lrc` (Claude Code integration):**

- Review, vouch, and skip inside Claude Code without leaving the chat surface
- Natural language or slash commands (`/lrc:review`, `/lrc:skip`, `/lrc:vouch`)
- Bundled with `git-lrc`, no separate install needed

Full CLI docs: [Getting Started](https://hexmos.com/livereview/docs/git-lrc/get-started/intro/) · [Reviewer Workflow](https://hexmos.com/livereview/docs/git-lrc/concepts/workflow/) · [Repository Rules](https://hexmos.com/livereview/docs/git-lrc/configure/repository-rules/) · [Security](https://hexmos.com/livereview/docs/git-lrc/git-lrc-security/)

#### Quick Install

**Linux/macOS:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://hexmos.com/lrc-install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
iwr -useb https://hexmos.com/lrc-install.ps1 | iex
```

</p>

#### git-lrc and claude-lrc in Action

`git-lrc` and `claude-lrc` are the two CLI tools above, in motion. Both plug into the same LiveReview backend.

**git-lrc catching real issues on commit:** leaked credentials, expensive cloud calls, and sensitive data in log statements, all flagged before the commit lands.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc4aa598-a7e3-4a1d-998c-9f2ba4b4c66e

**claude-lrc reviewing a diff inside Claude Code:** no separate terminal, no context switch, just a slash command or a plain-English request.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bff8595b-fcf0-47a2-b0af-859e6af656e3

**Issue Navigator:** every finding, filterable by severity, category, and subcategory, with a one-click send to your AI agent.

<p align="center">
   <img src="./assets/screenshots/git-lrc/issue-navigator.gif" alt="Issue Navigator: browse review comments by risk category, severity, and area" width="80%"/>
</p>

**Summary Deck:** a 60-second slide summary of what changed, why, and what risks were flagged, generated automatically for every review.

<p align="center">
   <img src="./assets/screenshots/git-lrc/summary-deck.gif" alt="Summary Deck: a 60-second slide summary of what changed and why" width="80%"/>

## Why LiveReview

Most AI review tools flag style nits and treat every line the same. LiveReview is built around three things most tools skip:

- **Blast-Radius scoring**: every hunk is ranked by how much of the system it can actually break, so reviewers spend their limited time on the change that could take down production, not the one that renamed a variable.
- **A named taxonomy of 104 failure patterns** across Reliability, Correctness, Security, Compliance, Maintainability, and Cost (see [Prevent Outages, Breaches, and Technical Debt](#impact-report)), checked on every commit, not just at PR time.
- **Livi, an AI chatbot for your engineering data**: ask any question in plain English — adoption, cost, quality, who's actually incorporating review feedback — and get a data-backed chart back, not a guess. See [Data-Backed Decisions](#data-backed-decisions).

LiveReview runs as an independent inspection layer on top of whatever writes your code — Claude, Copilot, Cursor, or anything else — rather than as part of the tool doing the writing. Blast-Radius scoring and the failure taxonomy change what gets reviewed. Livi changes what gets _decided_: every rollout, staffing, or process call is backed by real numbers pulled from your own review history, not gut feel. That combination is what leads teams to keep it turned on:

- **Accelerate Delivery Cycles**: Cut PR review time from hours to minutes, because reviewers see what matters first instead of reading top to bottom.
- **Save Senior Engineering Time**: Free senior developers from routine reviews. Let them focus on mentorship and high-impact architecture work.
- **Drive Quality Excellence**: Track metrics that show improvements in code standards, fewer defects, and better development efficiency.
- **Decide with Confidence, Not Guesswork**: Ask Livi instead of guessing. Every engineering, staffing, or process decision gets a chart pulled from real review history behind it.

## Pricing & Enterprise

LiveReview's pricing tracks **reviewed workload, not headcount**:

| Plan                  | Price                                                            | Includes                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Individual** (Free) | Free (30k LOC/month)                                             | Bring your own AI keys, unlimited projects, git-native CLI (`git-lrc`), dedicated VS Code extension                           |
| **Premium**           | From $32/month for 100k LOC, scaling to $1024/month for 3.2M LOC | Unlimited team members, AI-generated review summaries, custom review prompts, engineering insights dashboard, full API access |
| **Enterprise**        | [Contact us](https://hexmos.com/livereview?modal=start-free)     | Multiple organizations, self-hosted deployment, SSO/SAML & directory sync, custom domain, full data privacy                   |

LOC (Lines of Code) means the code shown in the reviewed diff, not your total repository size. Paid plans keep users unlimited, so cost tracks reviewed workload, not seats.

## How LiveReview Compares

### vs CodeRabbit

|                        | LiveReview                                                                          | CodeRabbit                                      |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Source code**        | Source-available, browse the full codebase and scan reports on GitHub               | Closed source                                   |
| **Enforcement point**  | Git level, same for every editor and OS                                             | Varies by integration                           |
| **Rate limits**        | None per developer                                                                  | Hourly rate limits per developer per repository |
| **Pricing model**      | Free up to 30k LOC/month, then fixed LOC bands ($32 for 100k, up to $1024 for 3.2M) | Per-seat pricing                                |
| **Cost as team grows** | Stays flat; tracks reviewed workload, not headcount                                 | Rises with headcount, even if workload does not |

### vs GitHub Copilot Code Review

|                               | LiveReview                                     | GitHub Copilot                               |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Git provider support**      | GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Gitea, Azure DevOps | GitHub only                                  |
| **Setup for other providers** | None needed, works out of the box              | Requires a separate product                  |
| **Pricing model**             | Tracks reviewed LOC, not seats                 | Caps premium requests at 300 on the Pro plan |
| **Users and projects**        | Unlimited, inside your monthly LOC quota       | Limited by plan tier                         |

### vs SonarQube

|                         | LiveReview                          | SonarQube                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Source availability** | Entire codebase is source-available | Only Community Edition is source-available; Developer and Enterprise editions are closed |
| **Self-host setup**     | One command, under 5 minutes        | Resource-intensive server, heavier dependency management                                 |

### vs Claude Code

|                     | LiveReview                                                                                               | Claude Code                                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intended use**    | Enforces standards org-wide, at the git level, across GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps | CLI tool built for individual developers on specific tasks             |
| **Source and data** | Source-available, self-hostable on Enterprise, data stays on your network                                | Closed product; sends your source code to Anthropic's cloud            |
| **Pricing model**   | LOC-based, predictable, tied to reviewed code                                                            | Token-metered; a few complex reviews can create hard-to-forecast costs |

### vs Cursor / Antigravity in-editor review

|                       | LiveReview                                                      | Cursor / Antigravity                                               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Visibility**        | Organization-wide, everyone sees the same findings              | Visible only to the individual using the tool                      |
| **Enforcement point** | Git level, same for every IDE, triggers automatically on commit | In-editor only; hard to enforce consistently across different IDEs |

## Security

### Built for security review

LiveReview documents the questions enterprise teams ask first: deployment model differences, code and data handling, AI safeguards, supply-chain visibility, and security response timelines.

- Separate guidance for self-hosted/Ollama and cloud LLM deployments
- Explicit data handling: what leaves your network, when it happens, and retention/deletion expectations
- Prompt-injection and unsafe-output mitigations, automated scanners, SBOM visibility, and transparent GitHub source with responsive disclosure policy

[Open Security Page](https://hexmos.com/livereview/security) · [Read SECURITY.md](https://github.com/HexmosTech/LiveReview/blob/master/.github/SECURITY.md) · [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/HexmosTech/LiveReview/security/advisories/new)

### Security FAQ

**What data is collected, stored, and used in LiveReview?**

- Only the diff is sent to the AI model. Nothing else.
- Your code is never stored, and never used to train any AI model.
- Own codebase is scanned continuously with Gitleaks, OSV Scanner, Govulncheck, and Semgrep, via GitHub Actions.
- A Bill of Materials (SBOM) is published with every release.

**How does self-hosted deployment differ from cloud in terms of security?**

- **Self-hosted**: your team runs the entire stack and database. Your infra team controls storage, backups, retention, and network access.
- **Cloud / provider-integrated**: LiveReview sends data to configured external provider endpoints for AI inference and git provider operations.

**Does LiveReview provide a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)?**
Yes, generated automatically on every release using Syft, published to GitHub release assets.

**Is LiveReview SOC 2 Type II certified?**
Not at this time. Security docs, scan history, SBOM, and source code are all public instead, so enterprise buyers can review the actual posture rather than take a certification on faith.

For complete details, including local security scan commands and how to enable the gated-off scanning workflows, see [SECURITY.md](.github/SECURITY.md). For pricing, LOC, and general product questions, see the [FAQ](#faq) below.

## FAQ

**What is Blast-Radius scoring, exactly?**
A per-hunk score combining:

- Call-graph reach and cross-package impact
- Persistent-state mutation
- Cyclomatic and cognitive complexity
- Test coverage gaps

Shows which parts of a diff can do the most damage if something is wrong, so reviewers spend their limited attention where it matters most.

**What is LOC in LiveReview?**
Lines of Code shown in the reviewed diff — not your total repository size.

**How much LOC is available on the premium plan?**
| LOC / month | Price |
|---|---|
| 100,000 | $32 |
| 200,000 | $64 |
| 400,000 | $128 |
| 800,000 | $256 |
| 1,600,000 | $512 |
| 3,200,000 | $1024 |

All paid bands keep users unlimited and refresh every month.

**What does the enterprise plan offer?**

- Multiple organization support
- SSO & directory sync (SAML/OIDC)
- Self-hosted deployment within your own infrastructure
- A custom domain
- Full data privacy over where your code and review data are stored

**Is my code secure with LiveReview?**
Only the diff is sent to the AI model, nothing else. Your code is never stored or used to train any model. See [Security](#security) above for full details.

**What's the difference between self-hosting this repo and the cloud version?**

- **This repo**: the self-hosted product itself, Docker-based, runs entirely on your infrastructure.
- **[Cloud version](https://hexmos.com/livereview/)**: the same review engine as a managed service, so you don't run the stack yourself.
