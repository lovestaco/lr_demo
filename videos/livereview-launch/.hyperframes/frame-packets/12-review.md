## Assigned storyboard block

## Frame 12 — Review

- handoff_in: the Review node arrives from the five-pillar ring at (960, 290), node box 260x88 radius 14, scale 1.00, opacity 1, motionless at the cut; it then travels to this frame's section-marker slot. Frames 9-13 each inherit their own node from Frame 8's locked ring — same box, same radius, same colour treatment.

Open on the pillar question as type, then hand the frame to the footage. **Crop the source's own
burned-in bottom-left caption out — reframing 21:9 to 16:9 from the sides does not remove it.**

Adapt: keep cursor-ui-demo's cursor-led surface tour, but the cursor is the footage's own in-app pointer — no synthetic cursor is drawn over real product video.

Scene 1 (0.0–1.8s): the **Review** node lifts out of F08's ring into the upper-left and becomes the section marker (`card-morph-anchor`); the pillar question sets beneath it per-word (`dynamic-content-sequencing`).
Scene 2 (1.8–4.2s): "what actually matters" — the footage card mounts right (0–5s review pipeline sankey), cropped `2192:830:164:0`, entering on a long-tail settle. Asymmetric 40/60.
Scene 3 (4.2–6.677s): "ranks every finding by how much it can hurt you" — the surface advances to the diff findings (21–23s) and `coordinate-target-zoom` frames the severity marks, the one place `negative` is allowed in this frame. Hold.

## Selected blueprint: cursor-ui-demo

# cursor-ui-demo — Cursor-Driven UI Demo

**intent**: A visible custom cursor drives a real (reconstructed) app UI through clicks / hovers / drags so the screen changes state shot-to-shot, while the camera chases each interaction — the product surface is the subject and the cursor is the actor.

**roles served**

- Product_Intro (from `product-intro-cursor-ui-demo`): first look at the product surface — the cursor sweeps/hovers to \_introduce\* the app and reveal what it is, landing on a hovered hero element or freshly-popped result. Light, exploratory; backdrop steps colors as it goes.
- Key_Feature (from `key-feature-cursor-ui-demo`): one specific multi-step workflow demonstrated \_end-to-end\* (edit / configure / select across 2–4 discrete beats), each beat a real edit the UI responds to live, landing locked on the primary action button or the produced result.
- Key_Feature (from `workflow-approve-press`): an agency / confirmation workflow framed by a cockpit of 3D-tilted flanks — a step list ticks pending → active → complete (a snap state machine, CSS responding to `[data-state]`), and a flank button takes the PRESS as the payoff (its color flips to success, a checkmark stamps). The click is the climax, not a passing gesture.
- Key_Feature (from `cursor-app-state-tour`): the static-stage STATE TOUR — the cursor drives a reconstructed app through 2–4 discrete feature states on a LOCKED frame; every scene change is a click-triggered element swap/scale (modal springs from center, side panel slides in from the right edge, settings hard-swap, table populates, node-graph builds), never a real camera move; optional `[title card]` Scene 0 in front and a `[brand end beat]` behind.
- Key_Feature (from `drag-field-onto-document`): the DRAG-DROP journey — one continuous zoom-breathing shot of a document workspace: the cursor drags a ghosted `[field chip]` from an inputs sidebar onto the page, drop-snaps it into a placed field, a modal/typing beat completes it, and the placed element is adjusted in close-up before the cursor heads to the `[Finish/CTA]`.
- Product_Intro: the low-event BROWSE — the cursor roams ONE clean page state and the filter controls answer with slight hover updates; no typed input, no title beats, and the shot may end mid-roam.
- Product_Intro (from `hover-inspect-run`): the HOVER-INSPECT run — a click SPAWNS a labeled `[toolbar]`, the camera zooms out from a tight crop to the full page, then the cursor sweeps `[page elements]` while a floating `[inspector panel]` TRACKS the cursor, outline-highlighting and content-snapping per hovered element. (The slice's three-beat dark title prelude, scenes 1–3, belongs to `titlecard-reveal`, not here.)
- Hook: the ambient MULTI-CURSOR canvas — several labeled `[teammate cursors]` work a design canvas simultaneously (grab-drag-drop of components between mockups, recolor/identity swaps on drop) while the canvas group translate-PANS within a static frame and a `[headline]` builds word-group by word-group over the demo; the live workshop itself is the hook. One continuous beat, no cuts, no camera.
- Benefits (from `ui-demo-text-interlude-ui-demo`): the demo|text|demo SANDWICH — two static-stage demo beats of this blueprint bridge through a full-screen kinetic/title interlude and back (cursor acts, UI answers, all "zoom" element scale); the interlude beat is `kinetic-type-beats` material, and the sandwich itself is sequencing above the single-shot unit.

**duration**: 4.0–12.9s (Key_Feature 4.0–12.9s — the mined state tours run long, 10.4–12.9s, and the drag-drop journeys 9.8–10.6s, against the original 4.0–7.3s set; Product_Intro 4.5–9.3s — the low-event browse sets the 4.5s floor; Hook ~6.5s; the Benefits demo|text|demo sandwich totals 11.6–12.8s with each demo half ~4–5s)

**shot structure** (a `[product UI surface]` — fixed app window, dashboard/editor, parallax `[content card]` stack, or a `[container object/icon]` — centered over `[bg color/gradient]`, shown `[flat]` or `[3D-isometric]`; a custom `[brand-colored cursor with icon]` is the protagonist and the camera servos to whatever it touches; UI responds _live_ and in sync with each cursor action. Two role-tuned tempos fold in — Product_Intro **sweeps to introduce**, Key_Feature **performs a workflow** — and the camera spans a spectrum: the full CHASE, one continuous zoom-breathe, or a fully LOCKED static stage where the UI itself does all the moving.)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~Xs) — surface establishes + first touch.** The `[product UI surface]` arrives centered over `[bg color/gradient]` — either it is simply present (fixed window / dashboard / editor), a 3D-parallax stack of `[content cards]`, or a `[container object/icon]` that FLIES IN with a 3D tumble and settles. The custom `[cursor]` enters. The cursor performs the FIRST action on `[cursor target 1]` and the UI responds live in the same beat. Camera holds or begins a slow push-in toward the acted-on region.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: low-commitment first touch — cursor HOVERS/sweeps a control or SWEEP-HIGHLIGHTS a field to `[accent color]`, OR the `[container]` fans open. An optional label/title fades/morphs onto the surface. The point is to _show the surface exists_ and is touchable.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature_: a concrete edit — cursor DRAGS a scrollbar / TYPES into a field / DRAGS a handle, and the UI responds materially (`[scroll]` / value climbs / region resizes). If the surface opened in `[3D-isometric]`, it may snap perspective-FLAT here to read the workflow.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature (static-stage tour)_: an optional Scene 0 — `[title card / kinetic brand word]` on a flat field — hard-cuts or window-SCALES-UP into the surface; the `[app UI]` is fully present from the first frame and the cursor enters and glides to the first control. The camera is LOCKED from the start and stays locked.
  - _Variant — Hook (ambient multi-cursor)_: no single protagonist — several labeled `[teammate cursors]` are already at work across `[N mockups]` on a design canvas; the canvas group translate-PANS within the static frame while a `[headline]` builds word-group by word-group over the top. One continuous beat, no cuts.

- **Scene 2 (~Xs–~Ys) — camera chases to the next interaction (the engine).** The camera MOVES to the next target — push-in + pan / whip-pan / pan-down to `[cursor target k]` — and the cursor performs action k as the UI updates live. Each beat is a discrete interaction connected by a fast camera move; the surface's inner content SWAPS per interaction.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: navigation is exploratory — a slow camera pan + depth-of-field FOCUS-PULL across a parallax `[content card]` stack, or the `[container]` fanning into `[N option/content cards]` that SPRING to position. As content swaps, the supporting backdrop STEPS its color (`[bg step 1]` → step 2 → …). Typically one or two such moves.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature_: repeat for `[2–4 beats total]`, each a distinct operation the UI answers — counter COUNTS UP, `[pill/swatch]` SELECTS, a modal SLIDES UP and TYPES — connected by whip-pans / progressive zoom. The workflow visibly advances toward a result.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature (static-stage tour)_: the camera never moves — every beat is a click-triggered ELEMENT response: a modal SPRINGS/scales up from center, a `[side detail panel]` SLIDES in from the right edge (a second panel may slide over the first), hamburger→sidebar slide-open, a settings panel HARD-swaps its content, a dropdown fills, a `[table]` populates row-by-row, a formula types into a cell and the range populates on enter, a type-to-filter list live-collapses, a `[block]` pops into the canvas, a node-graph BUILDS (cards + connecting lines radiate from center), a hover drops a `[popover]` below a tag. Any "zoom" is element scale of the UI only.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature (drag-drop)_: the cursor GRABS a `[field chip]` from an `[inputs sidebar]`, drags a semi-transparent GHOST across the page, and drops it — it SNAPS into a placed field with bounding box + corner handles; a completion beat follows (a `[modal]` springs up over the dimmed document, a name types letter-by-letter while a live `[cursive preview]` builds per keystroke, confirm click). The whole clip rides one continuous zoom-BREATHING arc (slow zoom-out / gentle zoom-in / final zoom-out) instead of discrete camera beats.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro (hover-inspect)_: the cursor's first click SPAWNS a labeled `[toolbar]`, the camera zooms OUT from a tight crop to the full page, then the cursor sweeps `[page elements]` — each hovered element gets an outline and a floating `[inspector panel]` TRACKS the cursor, its content snapping per element.

- **Scene 3 (~Ys–end) — payoff state, camera settles, HOLD.** The cursor lands on its final target and the screen reaches the payoff state; the camera comes to rest (static) and holds.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: the cursor HOVERS the hero element — a `[content card]` SCALES UP on hover, a node gets an `[Available]`-style pill, or a `[result card]` POPS/springs in — the "here's the product" payoff. Settles static, holds.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature_: locked close-up on the OUTCOME — cursor lands on the `[primary action button: Export / Save / Reimburse]` and a `[hover backdrop / highlight]` SPRING-pops in (the climax is the action button / produced result). Holds.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature (static-stage tour)_: optional detachable end beat — `[brand text beat / icon-ring lockup / end stat card]` — or the cursor simply comes to REST on the next target and holds (006_claudeai ends with the cursor on a panel's close X, the panel never closing).
  - _Variant — Key_Feature (drag-drop)_: close-up on the placed element ADJUSTED — a corner-handle drag proportionally resizes it — then the cursor sweeps toward the `[Finish / CTA]` as the clip ends.
  - _Variant — browse / hover-inspect_: no payoff lock at all — the shot ends MID-demo, cursor still roaming (browse and hover-inspect modes).

**rule mapping**

- viewport follows the cursor / camera servos to whatever it touches (primary) → `camera-cursor-tracking`
- cursor moves to a target, presses, emits a ripple (the click itself — primary interaction primitive) → `cursor-click-ripple`
- screen-state swap shot-to-shot (surface inner content changes between beats) → `scale-swap-transition`
- camera push-in + pan / whip-pan / pan-down to the next target → `viewport-change` (pan/zoom across the UI)
- sequencing the chase into discrete interaction beats → `multi-phase-camera`
- zoom onto the specific acted-on UI region → `coordinate-target-zoom`
- cursor icon/state changing with context (e.g. pointer↔grab over a draggable handle) → `context-sensitive-cursor`
- which content appears per beat / step-by-step UI state progression / per-interaction swaps → `dynamic-content-sequencing`
- sweep-highlight a field, highlight a UI keyword to `[accent color]` → `asr-keyword-glow` (keyword glow on the touched element)
- clicked button compresses on press, springs back on release → `press-release-spring`
- cursor + button compress together on a heavier press → `physics-press-reaction`
- panel/card morphs between two states (e.g. card → expanded card, surface state A → B) → `card-morph-anchor`
- terminal hover-scale, `[result card]` pop-in, spring hover-backdrop on the final action button → `spring-pop-entrance`
- card fan-out to corners / option cards springing to position → `split-tilt-cards` (fan/spread into tilted positions) + `spring-pop-entrance` (the spring settle)
- 3D-parallax content-card stack as the surface; UI shown 3D-isometric → `3d-page-scroll` (UI as a tilted scrolling/parallax card)
- node gets an `[Available]`-style pill / tracked badge appears on an element → `ai-tracking-box`
- counter / value count-up as the UI responds → `counting-dynamic-scale`
- a result bar / number FILLS as the workflow's outcome → `stat-bars-and-fills`
- a live `[video]` screen-capture clip used as the surface → technique: video compositing
- perspective-flatten (3D-isometric → flat 2D snap) and the 3D-isometric tilt itself → technique: CSS-3D (no dedicated rule; the tilt/flatten transform is a CSS-3D primitive)
- camera settles static on the payoff and HOLDS → (settle phase of `spring-pop-entrance` on the payoff element; the static hold itself needs no rule)
- 3D container/object fly-in & tumble-settle → `depth-scatter-assemble` (free-tumbling 3D object/container entrance that flies in and tumble-settles; `orbit-3d-entry` only orbits a flat element into place)
- depth-of-field focus-pull across the parallax card stack → `depth-of-field-blur` (rack-focus / DoF blur transition between near and far cards; `3d-page-scroll` supplies the tilted parallax stack and `viewport-change` the pan)
- paginated/stepped backdrop color advance synced to interactions (`[bg step 1]`→step 2→…) → `discrete-text-sequence` (discrete state stepping, here applied to a background-color state rather than text)
- modal slide-up + in-modal typing as one combined beat → `card-morph-anchor` / `scale-swap-transition` (the panel slide-in) + `discrete-text-sequence` (the in-modal typed text)
- element-scale fake zoom — the UI window scales, camera locked (static-stage tour) → `coordinate-target-zoom` (applied to the surface wrapper rather than the world)
- side detail panel slide-in from the right edge / hamburger→sidebar slide-open / hover popover drop → `card-morph-anchor` / `scale-swap-transition` (the panel arrival) + `dynamic-content-sequencing` (which content each panel shows per beat)
- hard panel swap / in-panel content snapping through states / hover-triggered micro update / type-to-filter live-collapse / element identity swap on drop → `dynamic-content-sequencing`
- table populates row-by-row / fill-handle auto-fill cascading down rows / log rows cascade in → `waterfall-entry`
- formula typed into a cell / character-by-character auto-typing with blinking caret / letter-by-letter typed name → `discrete-text-sequence` + `context-sensitive-cursor` (the caret)
- node-graph build (cards + connecting lines radiate from center) → `center-outward-expansion` (the cards) + `svg-path-draw` (the connecting lines draw)
- click spawns a labeled toolbar / dropdown fills on click / drop-snap settle of the placed field / window scale-up with settle → `spring-pop-entrance`
- modal spring-up over a dimming document → `spring-pop-entrance` (the modal) + `depth-of-field-blur` (the document dim/blur beneath)
- ghost-chip drag-and-drop / cursor grab-drag of components between mockups / fill-handle drag / corner-handle resize drag → `cursor-drag` (`cursor-click-ripple` covers move+click only)
- floating inspector panel TRACKS the cursor, content snapping per element → `ai-tracking-box` (the per-frame follow mechanics, restyled as an inspector panel) + `dynamic-content-sequencing` (the per-element content)
- live cursive preview building per typed keystroke → `svg-path-draw` (progressive stroke reveal keyed to typing progress)
- continuous zoom-breathing single shot (drag-drop variant) → `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back / focus / push phases + micro-drift)
- motion-blur window fly-in / tight-crop open then zoom-out to full page → `motion-blur-streak` (the fly-in) + `viewport-change` (the zoom-out)
- multiple labeled collaborative cursors moving independently → `multi-cursor-choreography` (N labeled independent cursor actors; the single-actor cursor rules assume one)
- canvas-group translate-pan within a static frame → `viewport-change` (the `.world` translate realizes the pan; semantically the camera stays locked)
- headline builds word-group by word-group over the demo → `waterfall-entry`
- brand icon-ring end beat → `svg-path-draw` (the ring) + `spring-pop-entrance` (the lockup)
- 3D end-card float on the hold → `sine-wave-loop` — CAUTION: motion-doctrine bans idle wobble; prefer a settle-and-hold

**camera modifier**: The defining motion is the camera CHASE — the viewport follows the cursor from target to target via `camera-cursor-tracking` (primary), realized as concrete push-in + pan / whip-pan / pan-down moves under `viewport-change`, sequenced into discrete interaction beats by `multi-phase-camera`, with each beat's destination targeted via `coordinate-target-zoom` (zoom to the acted-on region). Product_Intro biases toward a slow, exploratory pan + focus-pull that sweeps the surface; Key_Feature biases toward snappier whip-pans / progressive zoom that march through the workflow and lock static on the action button. This camera-servo-to-cursor is what separates the blueprint from hands-off camera scrolls (dataviz-scroll-reveal) and static device/window tours. The golden set widens this into a spectrum. At one pole the **static-stage state tour** (now the largest member set) LOCKS the camera for the entire clip and lets the UI itself do all the moving — panel slide-ins, element-scale fake zooms, content snaps — with the cursor alone carrying the eye. The **drag-drop** variant replaces discrete chase beats with ONE continuous zoom-breathing arc under `multi-phase-camera`. The **hover-inspect** variant inverts the push-in: a tight-crop open zooms OUT to the full page before the cursor sweep. Pick the pole per brief — chase for workflow marches, locked stage for dense reconstructed dashboards, a single breathe for one-document journeys. With the locked pole absorbed, what separates this blueprint from `device-surface-showcase` is the CURSOR-as-actor, not the camera: a fully static tour still belongs here as long as a visible cursor drives every state change.

# Card Morph Anchor

A free-floating container morphs apparent size, corner radius, and surface treatment between two shots — the morph itself IS the transition; the viewer's eye tracks the persistent container. Distinct from [anchored-layout-expand.md](anchored-layout-expand.md) (an edge-pinned live layout participant that grows along one axis and reflows neighbors — here nothing is pushed) and [theme-crossfade-morph.md](theme-crossfade-morph.md) (a whole-theme reskin under a fixed anchor — here a single container changes shape).

## How It Works

Since `width`/`height` tweens are forbidden, **substitute uniform `scale` for apparent size**; the remaining morph channels are **paint-only**: `borderRadius`, `background`, `boxShadow`. All channels ride ONE tween (one ease, one duration) so the shape morphs in lockstep. Content choreography: old content fades out during the first ~40% of the morph, new content fades in during the last ~40% — the shape-only gap between is the natural "blink." Optionally the morph card itself fades at the very end, revealing the real next-shot element rendered behind it.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<!-- DOM order = stacking: the anchor renders BEFORE the card, so the card is on top -->
<div class="next-shot-anchor"><img src="{nextShotAnchor}" alt="anchor" /></div>
<div class="morph-card">
  <div class="content-old">{shotOneContent}</div>
  <div class="content-new">{shotTwoContent}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.morph-card {
  width: SHOT_ONE_W;
  height: SHOT_ONE_H; /* shot-1 geometry; the morph is scale, never width/height */
  border-radius: SHOT_ONE_RADIUS;
  background: {surfaceShotOne};
  overflow: hidden; /* content must clip during the shape change */
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  will-change: transform;
}
.content-old,
.content-new {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
.content-new {
  opacity: 0; /* author its inner sizes at apparent-size ÷ END_SCALE — it scales with the card */
}
.next-shot-anchor {
  position: absolute;
  opacity: 0; /* fades in as the morph card fades out */
}
```

```js
const END_SCALE = SHOT_TWO_W / SHOT_ONE_W; // uniform — keep the two shots aspect-matched

// Hold shot 1 for HOLD_BEAT first — an instant morph reads as glitchy.

// One tween, all channels: uniform scale + paint-only properties.
tl.to(
  ".morph-card",
  {
    scale: END_SCALE,
    borderRadius: SHOT_TWO_RADIUS / END_SCALE, // borderRadius is pre-scale — divide to land the APPARENT radius
    background: "{surfaceShotTwo}",
    boxShadow: "{shadowShotTwo}",
    duration: MORPH_DUR,
    ease: "power2.inOut",
  },
  MORPH_START,
);

tl.to(
  ".content-old",
  { opacity: 0, duration: MORPH_DUR * OLD_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.in" },
  MORPH_START,
);
tl.to(
  ".content-new",
  { opacity: 1, duration: MORPH_DUR * NEW_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.out" },
  MORPH_START + MORPH_DUR * (1 - NEW_FADE_FRAC),
);

// Optional handoff — card fades out over the pixel-identical real anchor.
tl.to(
  ".morph-card",
  { opacity: 0, duration: MORPH_DUR * FINAL_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.in", immediateRender: false },
  MORPH_START + MORPH_DUR * (1 - FINAL_FADE_FRAC),
);
tl.to(
  ".next-shot-anchor",
  { opacity: 1, duration: MORPH_DUR * FINAL_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.out" },
  MORPH_START + MORPH_DUR * (1 - FINAL_FADE_FRAC),
);
```

## Morph channels

| channel        | how                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| apparent size  | uniform `scale` — the substitution for the forbidden `width`/`height` tween; aspect preserved  |
| `borderRadius` | paint-only; pre-scale units — tween to `APPARENT_RADIUS / END_SCALE`, ≤ half the smaller side  |
| `background`   | paint-only; gradients interpolate only with equal stop counts (solid→solid: `backgroundColor`) |
| `boxShadow`    | paint-only; base shadow → accent glow shifts emphasis                                          |

## Variations

- **Landing on a non-centered target** (dock icon, sidebar slot): add `x`/`y` to the same tween, computed as the FLIP-style delta between the card's and the target's rects — `getBoundingClientRect()` both at build time (single-scene only, per the contract) and tween the difference. Don't hand-compute from CSS values: paddings, borders, and parent transforms compound, and center-vs-edge arithmetic is the classic off-by-half bug.
- **Aspect change between shots**: uniform scale preserves aspect — morph to the nearest uniform fit and let the crossfade/handoff absorb the small delta, or drop the handoff and hold the card's final state.

## Values

| token             | range                     | notes                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| HOLD_BEAT         | 0.6–1.5s                  | ≥ shot 1's entry settle; the viewer must register shot 1 first                       |
| MORPH_DUR         | 0.6–1.2s                  | < 0.5s can't fit both content fades                                                  |
| END_SCALE         | SHOT_TWO_W / SHOT_ONE_W   | icon-sized handoffs typically land at 80–400px apparent width                        |

## Critical Constraints

- **❗ Uniform-scale substitution** — never tween `width`/`height`; `scale` + the paint-only channels (`borderRadius`, `background`, `boxShadow`) are the ONLY morph properties.
- **❗ Handoff anchor must be pixel-identical to the card's final state** — same apparent size, radius, background, shadow, inner icon dimensions. Any delta = a visible pop during the crossfade. Can't match exactly? Drop the handoff and hold the morph card.
- **❗ Stacking by DOM order, never a z-index snap mid-fade** — render the anchor before the card; a `tl.set({ zIndex })` during an active opacity tween flips stacking before the fade finishes and flickers.
- **`overflow: hidden`** on the card — content must clip as the radius changes.
- **Hold a beat before morphing**; same ease family for shape and crossfade (mixed eases read unsynchronized).

# Coordinate Target Zoom

A simple `scale > 1` on a wrapper pushes off-center content OFF the visible canvas. To zoom _into_ a specific non-centered element, apply scale AND an inverse translation in lockstep so the target lands at viewport center.

## How It Works

Two nested wrappers, separated concerns — never scale and translate on the SAME element (`translate * scale` ≠ `scale * translate` in CSS transform composition):

1. **Outer wrapper** applies `scale` (the zoom) around `transform-origin: 50% 50%`
2. **Inner wrapper** applies `translate(x, y)` (the counter-shift)

The counter-translate is the **negation** of the target's offset from viewport center:

```
T = -offset
```

Derivation: the inner translate moves the target to `offset + T` in pre-scale units; the outer scale S (around center) maps that to `S × (offset + T)`; landing at center means `S × (offset + T) = 0` → **`T = -offset`**. The formula does NOT depend on S — the translate is identical at 1.5×, 2×, or 3×. A common wrong intuition is `T = -offset × (S - 1)`: it coincidentally matches at S = 2 and is wrong at every other scale.

⚠️ **This is the NESTED-wrapper formula.** The single-wrapper camera in [viewport-change.md](viewport-change.md) puts `translate(x,y) scale(S)` on ONE element, where CSS applies scale first — there the counter-translate is **`T = -offset × S`**. The two formulas are not interchangeable; match the formula to the wrapper structure.

## Getting the offset

`T = -offset` is only as good as `offset`. The #1 way this pattern ships broken is hand-computing `offset` from a layout formula, getting the **sign** or magnitude wrong, and letting the zoom amplify a small error off-screen. **Default to measuring the target's real laid-out center; reserve the formula for symmetric rows.**

**Default — measure the actual center (works for ANY layout).** Immune to sign errors because it reads the rendered DOM, not a mental model:

```js
await document.fonts.ready; // metrics final; fallback fonts are 10–30px off → tens of px after a 3×+ zoom
const W = 1920,
  H = 1080;
const r = document.getElementById("target-card").getBoundingClientRect();
const TARGET_OFFSET_X = r.left + r.width / 2 - W / 2;
const TARGET_OFFSET_Y = r.top + r.height / 2 - H / 2;
```

Measure **once at setup** and bake — never per-frame in `onUpdate`. Because the measurement is async (`fonts.ready`), build and register the timeline inside the same `async` setup so the baked offset is ready before `window.__timelines[id]` is published.

**Shortcut — symmetric equal-width row ONLY:**

```js
const index_offset = targetIndex - (N - 1) / 2;
const TARGET_OFFSET_X = index_offset * (CARD_WIDTH + CARD_GAP);
```

⚠️ This assumes every sibling is the **same width**. The moment the row is asymmetric, it gives the wrong answer — often the wrong **sign**: the heavier side shifts the centered target the _opposite_ way you'd guess (e.g. `companion(220) + gap + wordmark + gap + chip(110)` puts the wordmark ~55px **right** of center, but "chip − companion" intuition says left). For anything but equal cards, **measure**.

**Headroom budget — cap the scale from the measured size.** A zoom multiplies any centering error; keep the target ≤ ~88% of the canvas at peak:

```js
const maxScale = Math.min((0.88 * W) / r.width, (0.88 * H) / r.height);
const ZOOM_SCALE = Math.min(DESIRED_SCALE, maxScale);
```

A target filling 97%+ of the frame reads as cut-off the instant its center is slightly off — and a hand-baked offset always is. (The perception gate flags this as `primary-offscreen`; `data-layout-allow-overflow` does **not** exempt it.)

## Recipe

```html
<div class="zoom-outer" id="zoom-outer">
  <div class="zoom-inner" id="zoom-inner">
    <div class="content">
      <div class="card">{other}</div>
      <div class="card target" id="target-card">{target}</div>
      <div class="card">{other}</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.scene {
  overflow: hidden; /* REQUIRED — at zoom > 1 the scaled content leaks past the frame */
}
.zoom-outer {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* center scaling is what the counter-translate math assumes */
  will-change: transform;
}
.zoom-inner {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
// TARGET_OFFSET_X/Y and ZOOM_SCALE come from "Getting the offset" — measured
// at setup (after fonts.ready), baked. Counter-translation = -offset.
const counterX = -TARGET_OFFSET_X;
const counterY = -TARGET_OFFSET_Y;

// Scale and counter-translate MUST share position, duration, AND ease —
// otherwise the target visibly wanders mid-zoom.
tl.to("#zoom-outer", { scale: ZOOM_SCALE, duration: ZOOM_DUR, ease: "power3.inOut" }, ZOOM_AT);
tl.to(
  "#zoom-inner",
  { x: counterX, y: counterY, duration: ZOOM_DUR, ease: "power3.inOut" },
  ZOOM_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Zoom out (target → wide view)**: reverse the phases — start zoomed-in, then tween to `scale: 1` + `x: 0, y: 0`; the "reveal" beat is the panorama.
- **Multi-target zoom sequence**: chain zooms (target A → pause → target B → pull back); each segment needs its own counter-translation pair.

## Critical Constraints

- **Outer scales, inner translates** — never both transforms on one element; nested wrappers keep the math clean.
- **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on the outer wrapper** — non-center origin breaks the counter-translate derivation.
- **`overflow: hidden` on the scene root** — zoomed content leaks past the frame otherwise.
- **Scale and counter-translate share duration + ease** at the same timeline position, or the target drifts mid-zoom.
- **Offset measured once at setup** (after `fonts.ready`), baked — never recomputed per-frame, never hand-derived for a non-symmetric layout (wrong sign → target shoved off-frame).
- **Scale within the headroom budget** — target ≤ ~88% of the canvas at peak, derived from the measured size.

# Dynamic Content Sequencing

A utility pattern (not a motion rule in itself) for scenes that show a SEQUENCE of items (cards, phrases, stats): each item's duration is computed from its content length + per-item config, and the sequencer assigns absolute start/end times automatically — no hardcoded offsets per item. Distinct from [discrete-text-sequence](discrete-text-sequence.md) (one text element changing states) — this rule swaps between distinct content blocks.

## How It Works

A content array of `{ eyebrow, title, body, speedFactor, hold }` entries is reduced once at build time into a flat `TIMELINE` of `{ …entry, start, end }` — duration per entry is `BASE_DURATION + body.length × SEC_PER_CHAR + hold`, so longer text earns more reading time. A single linear driver's `onUpdate` reverse-searches the active entry and swaps the DOM **only on transitions** (a `lastTitle` guard — per-frame `textContent` writes flicker in render); an optional progress bar fills 0→100% across the whole run.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="display">
  <div class="eyebrow" id="eyebrow"></div>
  <div class="title" id="title"></div>
  <div class="body" id="body"></div>
  <div class="progress-bar"><div class="progress-fill" id="progress-fill"></div></div>
</div>
```

```css
.body {
  min-height: 160px; /* reserve space — content height varies; without this, layout jumps */
}
.progress-fill {
  height: 100%;
  width: 0%;
}
```

```js
// N entries, each with its own pacing (optionally a speedFactor multiplier);
// the final entry uses a larger hold (closing beat).
const CONTENT = [
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrow1}", title: "{title1}", body: "{body1}", hold: HOLD_MID },
  // …
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrowN}", title: "{titleN}", body: "{bodyN}", hold: HOLD_FINAL },
];

// Pre-compute absolute start/end ONCE — never in onUpdate.
let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry) => {
  const dur = BASE_DURATION + entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR + entry.hold;
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});

function entryAt(time) {
  for (let i = TIMELINE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= TIMELINE[i].start) return TIMELINE[i];
  }
  return TIMELINE[0];
}

const eyebrowEl = document.getElementById("eyebrow");
const titleEl = document.getElementById("title");
const bodyEl = document.getElementById("body");
const progressEl = document.getElementById("progress-fill");

const TOTAL_DURATION = cumulative + TAIL_PAD;
const driver = { t: 0 };
let lastTitle = "";

tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const entry = entryAt(driver.t);
      // Swap content only on transitions — no per-frame DOM thrash
      if (entry.title !== lastTitle) {
        eyebrowEl.textContent = entry.eyebrow;
        titleEl.textContent = entry.title;
        bodyEl.textContent = entry.body;
        lastTitle = entry.title;
      }
      progressEl.style.width = `${(driver.t / TOTAL_DURATION) * 100}%`;
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Crossfade between items** — return BOTH adjacent entries during an overlap window (`time ≥ e.start − overlap && time ≤ e.end + overlap`, overlap ≈ 0.3s) and render them with opacities computed from distance to the boundary.
- **Per-item motion variation** — map an `entry.style` key to an existing rule per chapter (e.g. `3d-text-depth-layers` → `hacker-flip-3d` → `counting-dynamic-scale`); the sequencer only orchestrates timing.
- **Auto-extend composition duration** — you can set `data-duration` from the computed `TOTAL_DURATION` in script, but HF reads `data-duration` at composition load and setting it after init may not take effect — author the duration manually from a rough total.

### Accelerating cadence (geometric hold decay)

For rhetorical escalation — "everyone says…", a roll-call, a praise flurry — the beat grid itself accelerates: early entries hold ~1s (read speed), then windows shrink geometrically into a ~0.15–0.3s flurry, braking on an emphasis state before the resolve. The acceleration is pre-computed into the same flat `TIMELINE` — still content-driven, still deterministic, no speed-up tween anywhere:

```js
// Geometric decay on the hold, clamped at a flurry floor; the brake state holds longest.
const HOLDS = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => Math.max(FLURRY_FLOOR, HOLD_START * Math.pow(DECAY, i)));
HOLDS[CONTENT.length - 1] = HOLD_FINAL;

let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => {
  // Past ~0.5s states are glanced as motion texture, not read —
  // drop the per-char term or you never reach flurry speed.
  const readable = HOLDS[i] >= READ_THRESHOLD;
  const dur = HOLDS[i] + (readable ? entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR : 0);
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});
```

Worked example — **praise-chip flurry**: ~16 short quotes hard-cut through a chip beside a pinned wordmark. First 3 states at `HOLD_START = 1.0` (each reads fully); `DECAY = 0.8` shrinks every following window until `FLURRY_FLOOR = 0.2` catches it (≈12 states over ~2.5s — a churn of acclaim, individually glanced); the longest phrase takes `HOLD_FINAL ≈ 1.6` as the brake before the closing lockup.

Values: `HOLD_START` 0.8–1.2s; `DECAY` 0.75–0.88 (higher = longer runway before the flurry bites); `FLURRY_FLOOR` 0.15–0.3s (below ~0.15s swaps strobe); `READ_THRESHOLD` ~0.5s; brake ≥ 4× the floor or the stop doesn't register as a beat. The 3–6 entry guidance relaxes here — 12–18 states are legal precisely because flurry states aren't individually read. The hard-cut discipline (`lastTitle` guard, instant swaps) is what lets 0.2s states render clean.

## Critical Constraints

- **Pre-compute the TIMELINE once at build** — never recompute in `onUpdate`; the reverse search over the flat array is the whole per-frame cost.
- **DOM swap only on entry transition** (`lastTitle`/key guard) — per-frame `textContent` assignment flickers in HF render.
- **`min-height` on the body element** — without reservation, downstream elements (progress bar, brand) jitter as content height varies.
- **Sequential only** — for parallel tracks use a different reduction.
- **Titles fit one line at the chosen size; bodies fit inside `min-height` after wrapping.**
