The factor cards assemble in a staggered cascade and hold. Land on Math Mode (the demo video's
~42s beat, or the new-risk-score-3 still) so the closing image is literal arithmetic. Two
scores, named plainly: Blast Radius (how far) and Review Priority (how much scrutiny).

Reproduce: grid-card-assemble's staggered self-assembly, then hand off to the artifact. One card per spoken factor — the cascade is cued by the list, not by a timer.

Scene 1 (0.0–1.8s): "Not a black box." — the line lands alone, centre-left, on a percussive but smooth beat-slam (`kinetic-beat-slam`, long-tail settle, no overshoot).
Scene 2 (1.8–5.4s): the four factor cards self-assemble in a staggered cascade (`center-outward-expansion`), **one per spoken factor** — callers, storage writes, nesting, test coverage — each landing exactly on its word. 2x2, ~55% of frame.
Scene 3 (5.4–7.2s): "and the math behind them" — the cards recede and the Math Mode panel scale-swaps into their place (`scale-swap-transition`), formulas legible at read size.
Scene 4 (7.2–8.32s): `asr-keyword-glow` touches the two score names — Blast Radius, then Review Priority — as the frame settles. Hold still.

## Selected blueprint: grid-card-assemble

# grid-card-assemble — Grid / Card Assemble

**intent**: N items (tiles / cards / logos / list-lines) self-assemble in a staggered cascade into a grid or vertical list and hold — a "look how much / who / what it does" beat that enumerates breadth at once; an optional camera zoom-OUT pulls back to reveal the assembled array sitting inside a vaster whole.

**roles served**

- Key_Feature (from key-feature-card-grid-assemble): a grid of labeled feature tiles/pills (icon + label) cascades one-by-one into a 2-col-brick / 3×3 grid, then holds near-static with a slow push-in — enumerate many capabilities, no live UI, no cursor.
- Key_Feature (from key-feature-glass-card-camera-reveal): open TIGHT on 2–3 glowing icons; a camera zoom-OUT unfolds a row of glassmorphism cards that grow from behind the icons (icons shrink to card headers), center card scales forward, the group floats, then sweeps out — a "pillars revealed at once" reveal variant of the same assemble shape.
- Benefits (from benefits-vertical-list): short value phrases populate a single vertical list ~1 item/sec, co-resident and accumulating; each line enters via a spring marker-pop + check-draw + pill mask-wipe, OR the whole stack snaps up one slot per beat (slot-machine) so the newest lands in the bright focal slot.
- Social_Proof (from social-proof-logo-grid-zoom-out): a wall of partner/app logos builds into a center grid (whole-enter / randomized pop-in / column slide-up), an optional headline + accent-gradient proof-number fills in above, then a continuous camera zoom-OUT shrinks the array to reveal a vast ecosystem; optional fixed HUD/viewfinder brackets; optional grid slide-up fly-out exit.
- Key_Feature (from live-data-populate-board): the array assembles by POPULATING ITSELF — skeleton pills fill and swap to real data, cards spring in tethered to map markers — and its state keeps flipping live after assembly (status pills stepping through states); no cursor, locked frame. The "look how much" beat becomes "look, it's doing it right now."
- Benefits (from item-field-to-payoff-card): a breadth FIELD — a rapidly streaming list past a fixed focal slot, or a chip array with one highlighted hero — plays its breadth motion, then CLEARS to concise centered payoff text (claim / price / URL end card). The array is the argument's setup; the payoff line is its landing.

**duration**: 3.0–10.5s (Social_Proof 3.0–6s · live-populate 4.2–7.8s · Key_Feature grid 5.8–7.3s · Benefits stream/field-to-payoff 5.9–8.4s · Key_Feature glass-card 6.5s · Benefits list 6.5–10.5s, scaling ~1 item/sec with count)

**shot structure** (consolidated template — concrete motion verbs, [slots])

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~1.0s) — open + first arrivals.** On a `[gradient / radial / dark background]` (optional `[dot-grid / drifting-watermark]` texture), an empty `[grid or list region]` is established and items begin to ASSEMBLE in a quick staggered cascade (~0.04–0.08s gap; list pacing ~1 item/sec). Each `[item: feature tile / pill / logo tile / benefit line]` fades + slides/scales a short distance directly into its slot (low drama — no scatter, no big bounce; spring overshoot reserved for accent markers). Camera static. An opening `[headline / hook]` may fill in line-by-line above the array, with any `[proof number]` counting up in an `[accent gradient]`.
- **Scene 2 (~1.0s–~Xs) — array resolves + holds.** Remaining items finish arriving; layout resolves into the final `[2-col-brick / 3×3 grid / dense mosaic / stacked list]`. The completed array HOLDS, alive but resting: a gentle continuous parallax/sine FLOAT on the tiles and/or a slow camera push-in (faint scale-up). Optional `[accent-color]` glow TRAVELS across/behind the tiles.
- **Scene 3 (~Xs–end) — settle / reveal / exit.** Everything settles and holds to the end, OR the optional camera modifier runs (see below), OR a `[closing line / CTA]` book-ends the array. OR the field CLEARS to payoff copy — the array exits and a concise centered `[claim / price / URL]` lands (price via a very fast character snap-build with a split-second partial state; URL via a left-to-right reveal, holding in `[accent]` and flipping to `[ink]` only in the final beat) — OR the camera PUSHES THROUGH one highlighted `[hero item]` (single rapid accelerating push-in) and crossfades into a second, vaster receding `[word-grid depth field]` that continuously scales down to reveal ever more items before fading to the payoff.

Variants (where roles diverge from the template):

- **Variant — Key_Feature grid**: items are labeled `[icon + feature-label]` tiles/pills assembling into a 2-col-brick / 3×3 grid; near-static hold with slow push-in + optional traveling-glow sweep; headline book-ends (`[hook]` → `[CTA]`). No camera reveal.
- **Variant — Key_Feature glass-card-reveal**: the assemble is CAMERA-DRIVEN, not element-stagger. Open tight on `[2–3 glowing icons]`; camera zoom-OUT grows `[N]` glass cards out from behind the icons (icons shrink ~50% to become card headers), `[center card]` scales ~105% and moves forward to overlap the sides (quick spring); cards hold side-by-side with continuous parallax float; exit = fast motion-blur SWEEP slides the cards off-frame.
- **Variant — Benefits vertical-list**: a single vertical `[benefit-line]` stack, ~1 item/sec, three sub-modes — (a) BUILD: each line stays fully lit; entry = `[marker]` spring-pop + `[check/icon]` draw-in + `[pill]` mask-wipe of the text; (b) SNAP: the whole stack steps up one slot per beat (~0.1s eased) so the newest line lands in the bright focal slot and lines leaving it dim by position; (c) STREAM: the list scrolls rapidly and continuously past the focal slot — center item opaque `[ink]` and slightly enlarged, neighbors faded/shrunk — then DECELERATES to stop on the `[chosen item]`; optionally split-framed against a fixed static `[label]` on the opposite side; the field then clears to a centered `[payoff line]`. Static camera; optional perpetual `[decorative orbit/disc]` on the opposite side. No camera reveal.
- **Variant — Key_Feature live-populate**: the assemble is a DATA-POPULATION wave, cursorless, frame locked (± one gentle opening zoom-out that makes room for the `[headline]`). Two board shapes — (a) ANCHORED: `[white data cards]` spring in one-by-one, each tethered by a thin line to its `[marker]` on a `[map/board surface]` whose markers pulse (expanding fading rings); (b) TABULAR: new `[columns]` appear as grey skeleton pills, progress fills run left→right staggered top-to-bottom (colored fill with a leading tip), each bar SWAPPING to its real `[value/avatar chip]` on completion. After assembly the array stays LIVE: `[status pills]` flip states in quick snappy swaps (color-coded, several in succession), or the `[headline]` crossfades and a second population wave runs on a newly revealed region — the table content scrolling horizontally beneath a sticky first column to expose it. Hold lands on the fully populated, fully updated final state.
- **Variant — Social_Proof logo-wall-zoom-out**: intro beat (`[trusted-by headline]` card OR a `[product screenshot]`) crossfades/cuts to a center logo grid that builds (whole-enter / randomized pop-in / column slide-up); a continuous camera zoom-OUT then shrinks the whole grid toward center to reveal a vast ecosystem and holds; optional fixed HUD/viewfinder brackets; optional exit = whole grid SLIDES UP and flies out through the top.

**rule mapping** (motion verb → `rule-id`)

- item stagger-assemble into slot → `center-outward-expansion` (per-item stagger + short-path slide variant; for a wall too dense for a true center burst, use it in its "starting partially-spread"/direct-into-slot form — see merge tension)
- brick/grid/list layout resolve → `center-outward-expansion` (target positions = final layout slots)
- randomized pop-in stagger → `gsap-effects` (stagger recipe; randomized `from`/order)
- column slide-up into grid → `gsap-effects` (per-column staggered slide-up)
- vertical-list step / slot-machine snap-and-hold → `vertical-spring-ticker` (STEPS = number of line advances)
- spring-overshoot marker pop → `spring-pop-entrance` (back.out spring) — also `gsap-effects` for the staggered pop chain
- check / icon draw-in inside marker → `svg-path-draw`
- live line-art icon in a tile (internal parts) → `svg-icon-enrichment`
- pill / label mask-wipe text reveal → `techniques.md` (clip-path reveal)
- dim-by-position de-emphasis → `gsap-effects` (per-line opacity by slot position; no dedicated rule)
- line-by-line headline fill → `discrete-text-sequence`
- accent-gradient proof number count-up → `counting-dynamic-scale`
- gentle parallax / sine float on hold → `sine-wave-loop` (apply the concurrent-elements amplitude `/√N` rule for a held grid)
- slow camera push-in → `multi-phase-camera` (steady-push phase pattern)
- center-card scale-up + forward overlap → `spring-pop-entrance` (the quick spring) + `techniques.md` CSS-3D (z-depth overlap)
- cards-grow-from-behind-icons / icon-shrink-to-header → driven by the camera reveal (`multi-phase-camera`) — the grow/shrink are scale tweens chorded to the pull-back phase; no separate rule
- fixed HUD / viewfinder brackets → `ai-tracking-box` (static-bracket variant — overlay frame, not tracking)
- book-end headline fade → `discrete-text-sequence` (or `gsap-effects` fade)
- perpetual decorative orbit / disc / loop → `sine-wave-loop` (or `orbit-3d-entry` if it's an orbiting badge ring)
- traveling-glow sweep across/behind tiles → `ambient-glow-bloom` (one-pass traveling glow sweep across the tiles)
- motion-blur slide-out sweep (glass-card exit) → `motion-blur-streak` (directional velocity blur on the fast sweep that carries the cards off-frame)
- grid slide-up fly-out exit → `gsap-effects` (plain staggered translate-off-frame; no dedicated rule needed — a basic exit tween, not a missing capability)
- skeleton-pill progress fill → `stat-bars-and-fills` (progress-fill `scaleX` form; the leading tip is a chorded child element)
- fill-completes-swap-to-real-data / live status-pill flips / headline crossfade between waves → `discrete-text-sequence` (whole-state replacement at time thresholds — the pill's states are text states)
- staggered top-to-bottom fill cascade → `gsap-effects` (per-row stagger on the fill tweens)
- tethered-card spring-in → `spring-pop-entrance` (the card) + `avatar-cloud-network` (the thin connection-line-to-anchor layout; anchor coordinates must match the marker exactly) + `svg-path-draw` if the tether draws in
- pulsing marker rings → `cursor-click-ripple` (its expanding-ring + attack-decay opacity envelope, minus the cursor/click, on a bounded repeat)
- sticky-column internal horizontal scroll → `viewport-change` (PAN form on the inner column layer; the sticky column sits outside the panned layer) — mark the moving layer `data-layout-allow-overflow` and clip at the table card
- rapid vertical stream past a focal slot + deceleration stop → `vertical-spring-ticker` (continuous form: one long decelerating translate instead of its stepped tweens; focal-slot emphasis reuses the dim-by-position mapping above)
- pill-widens-as-label-fills → `card-morph-anchor`'s substitution law (uniform `scaleX`/clip-path — never tween `width`) + `discrete-text-sequence` for the label fill
- push-through-the-hero-item exit → `multi-phase-camera` (single accelerating push phase) aimed via `coordinate-target-zoom` at the highlighted chip, crossfading at peak
- receding word-grid depth field → `viewport-change` (one `.world` wrapper, `cam.scale` ↓ continuously — the zoom-OUT reveal grammar pointed at a word field; size/opacity tiers fake the depth)
- price snap-build (split-second partial state) → `discrete-text-sequence` (non-linear typing with bulk additions — exactly its typo/partial-state mechanic)
- left-to-right URL reveal → `techniques.md` (clip-path reveal — same mapping as the pill mask-wipe); the final-beat color flip → `gsap-effects` (a `tl.set` at the beat — basic, no rule needed)

**camera modifier — zoom-OUT reveal** (optional; the role-defining move for the glass-card and logo-wall variants): a camera wrapper around the whole array scales DOWN over the hold, revealing the assembled grid/cards sitting inside a larger environment (ecosystem scale, or a row of cards unfolding from tight icons).

- Continuous single-pass zoom-out (Social_Proof ecosystem pull-back) → `viewport-change` (one wrapper, `cam.scale` ↓ via onUpdate — single source of truth)
- Phased pull-back → focus → settle, with built-in drift (Key_Feature tight-icons → cards-unfold) → `multi-phase-camera` (use the "Dramatic reveal: push → neutral → pull" / pull-back phase pattern; grow/shrink of cards chords to the pull-back phase)

---

```
BLUEPRINT: grid-card-assemble — serves Key_Feature, Benefits, Social_Proof (folded 4 drafts + 2 mined clusters: live-data-populate-board, item-field-to-payoff-card)
RULE COVERAGE: complete, no gaps — traveling-glow sweep → ambient-glow-bloom; motion-blur slide-out sweep (exit) → motion-blur-streak; grid slide-up fly-out (exit) → gsap-effects (plain translate); skeleton-fill populate → stat-bars-and-fills + discrete-text-sequence; push-through-hero exit → multi-phase-camera + coordinate-target-zoom
```

Merge tension: `center-outward-expansion` (the natural backing for stagger-assemble) caps cleanly at 3–8 items and explicitly warns 8+ causes mid-flight overlap chaos — but a Social_Proof logo wall is deliberately dense (12+ tiles), so for that variant the items must NOT burst from a shared center; they slide a short distance directly into their own slot (the rule's "starting partially-spread"/short-path form, or a `gsap-effects` per-item stagger), which the consolidated Scene-1 verb already specifies as "short distance directly into its slot."

# ASR Keyword Glow

Words in a phrase visually activate (glow blur + scale) when "spoken", following an attack-sustain-release envelope over per-word `{ start, end }` timestamps. In a real ASR pipeline the timings come from a word-level transcript (`hyperframes transcribe` — same shape); for promo video, hand-author them to control emphasis pacing. The envelope never falls to zero after a word — it decays to a rest level, leaving a breadcrumb of recent emphasis.

## How It Works

A single linear driver tween (`ease: "none"` — any other ease distorts the per-word envelope; do not change) sweeps scene time; its `onUpdate` loops over ALL words computing each one's envelope: 0 before `start`, linear attack to 1 over `ATTACK_DUR`, sustain at 1 until `end`, decay to `REST_LEVEL` over `RELEASE`, then hold at rest. The envelope drives `text-shadow` blur and `scale` — one driver for the whole phrase, never one tween per word (60+ words would bloat the timeline).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="phrase">
  <span class="word" data-word="{w1Key}">{w1}</span>
  <span class="word" data-word="{w2Key}">{w2}</span>
  <!-- … the final word may be the brand, with the .brand modifier -->
  <span class="word brand" data-word="{brandKey}">{brandWord}</span>
</div>
```

```css
.phrase {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: center;
  color: {restColor};
}
.word {
  display: inline-block; /* required for transform on <span> */
  transform-origin: 50% 50%;
  text-shadow: 0 0 0 {glowColorTransparent};
}
.word.brand {
  color: {brandAccentColor};
}
```

```js
// Per-word spoken windows — one entry per span; brand word 1.5-2× a normal word's window.
const TIMINGS = {
  // {w1Key}: { start: …, end: … },  — seconds, local to the scene
};

function envelope(time, start, end) {
  if (time < start) return 0;
  if (time < end) return Math.min((time - start) / ATTACK_DUR, 1);
  const releaseEnd = end + RELEASE;
  if (time < releaseEnd) return 1 - ((time - end) / RELEASE) * (1 - REST_LEVEL);
  return REST_LEVEL;
}

const words = document.querySelectorAll(".word");
const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: SCENE_DURATION,
    duration: SCENE_DURATION,
    ease: "none", // linear — t maps 1:1 to scene time
    onUpdate: () => {
      words.forEach((el) => {
        const timing = TIMINGS[el.dataset.word];
        if (!timing) return;
        const env = envelope(driver.t, timing.start, timing.end);
        el.style.textShadow = `0 0 ${MAX_BLUR * env}px ${glowColorRgba(env)}`;
        el.style.transform = `scale(${1 + MAX_SCALE_BOOST * env})`;
      });
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

`glowColorRgba(env)` returns the glow color with `env`-modulated alpha.

## Variations

- **Karaoke style (RECOMMENDED for video narration)** — the default amplitudes read too subtle in video: inactive words still dominate. Render inactive words DIM and lerp the active word toward bright + larger; at any moment 1–2 words are bright (spoken + lingering rest) and the rest is dim. Use for short phrases (5–10 words) where one word at a time should POP; keep the subtle default for long dense text. Pushes MAX_BLUR, MAX_SCALE_BOOST, and REST↔ACTIVE contrast; everything else identical:

```js
function lerpChannel(a, b, t) {
  return Math.round(a + (b - a) * t);
}
function colorAt(env, isBrand) {
  const target = isBrand ? BRAND_RGB : ACTIVE_RGB;
  return `rgb(${lerpChannel(REST_RGB.r, target.r, env)}, ${lerpChannel(REST_RGB.g, target.g, env)}, ${lerpChannel(REST_RGB.b, target.b, env)})`;
}
// in onUpdate: el.style.color = colorAt(env, el.classList.contains("brand"));
```

- **Multi-octave glow** — multiply the sustain by `1 + sin(driver.t × PULSE_HZ) × PULSE_AMPLITUDE` so high-emphasis words breathe at peak.
- **Color shift on the peak** — same channel-lerp from `restColor` → `peakColor` as `env` rises (non-karaoke form).
- **3D pop-out** — add `translateZ(env × MAX_POP_Z)` so the spoken word leans toward camera; requires `perspective` on the parent.
- **From real ASR transcripts** — convert `{ word, start_ms, end_ms }` entries to seconds and feed in identically.

## Values

| MAX_SCALE_BOOST | 0.03–0.10            | 0.15–0.25     | additive at peak (0.08 ⇒ scale 1.08)                       |
| PULSE_HZ / AMP  | 4–10 rad/s / 0.1–0.3 | —             | multi-octave variation                                     |
| MAX_POP_Z       | 20–60px              | —             | 3D variation                                               |
| SCENE_DURATION  | = `data-duration`    | same          | driver must end in sync with the scene's seek window       |

## Critical Constraints

- **Timings monotonic, non-overlapping** — every entry's `end` < the next entry's `start`; overlapping windows make the envelope ambiguous.
- **Brand word window 1.5–2× a normal word** — the brand is the headline; let it sustain.
- **Driver ease stays `"none"`** — any other ease warps every word's envelope timing.
- **`text-shadow`, not `box-shadow`** — the glow must hug the GLYPH (speaking emphasis), not the inline-block rectangle.
- **One driver looping all words** — never one tween per word.
- **Commit to a style** — values between the default and karaoke columns yield awkward "half-loud" emphasis.
- **Climax dwell ≥1s** after the final word's emphasis — the last word IS the headline beat.

## Selected motion rule: center-outward-expansion

# Center-Outward Expansion

Elements begin at one shared center point and radiate outward to their final positions — the entry beat itself, or motion driven by another animation's progress (a counting number, a beat). Flat 2D cousin of [depth-scatter-assemble.md](depth-scatter-assemble.md) (per-element 3D cloud): here every element shares the SAME origin.

## How It Works

Each element carries its final offset as `data-target-x/y`. Its position lerps between center and target: `x = targetX × progress`. Self-centering is baked as `xPercent/yPercent: -50` so the tweened `x`/`y` are pure offsets from the stage center. Standalone burst = per-item staggered `fromTo`; driven burst = one shared proxy (see Variations).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="burst-wrap">
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="-360" data-target-y="-180">{itemA}</div>
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="360" data-target-y="-180">{itemB}</div>
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="0" data-target-y="360">{itemC}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.burst-wrap {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
.burst-item {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%; /* GSAP xPercent/yPercent -50 bakes the centering; x/y tween the offset */
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
document.querySelectorAll(".burst-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { xPercent: -50, yPercent: -50, x: 0, y: 0, scale: 0.6, opacity: 0 },
    {
      x: Number(el.dataset.targetX),
      y: Number(el.dataset.targetY),
      scale: 1,
      opacity: 1,
      duration: EXPAND_DUR,
      ease: EXPAND_EASE,
    },
    ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});

- **Synced to a driver (chord)**: when the burst shadows a counter / beat, drop the stagger and drive all items from ONE 0→1 proxy tween with the driver's exact duration AND ease; `onUpdate` writes `translate(-50%,-50%) translate(targetX*p, targetY*p)` per item — the two read as one beat.
- **Partially-spread start**: with 6+ items the full cluster piles up — start from `{ x: targetX * START_PROGRESS, ... }`.
- **Idle micro-float**: hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) after landing instead of freezing.

## Critical Constraints

- **Tween `x`/`y` over the baked `xPercent/yPercent: -50`** — mutating `left`/`top` fights the centering and causes pixel jitter.
- **Out-easing only** — `in` easings read as items being sucked back mid-air.
- **No other absolute-positioned siblings inside `.burst-wrap`** — they'd steal the centered baseline.
- **❗ The burst IS the beat** — don't park a "real headline" label below it (the eye snaps to the label and ignores the burst). If a label is needed, reveal it post-burst in the same stack.
- Synced variant: identical duration + ease as the driver, or the chord falls apart.

# Kinetic Beat Slam

Short phrases hit one at a time on a **steady beat**, each with a _different_ entrance, then stack into a locked finale — the recipe for "punchy / rhythmic" text-forward pieces (taglines, manifestos, hype intros). The difference between generic and rhythmic is (1) one shared **onset array** driving every element, (2) **distinct** entrances per phrase rather than one reused helper, and (3) optional **rhythm chrome** that visibly keeps the beat.

## How It Works

A single tempo grid — `PULSE` seconds per sub-beat, `BEATS = [t0, t1, t2, …]` on that grid — is the rhythmic spine; every phrase entrance, accent, and chrome tick reads its time from it, so the piece locks to one pulse instead of drifting hand-tuned offsets. Each phrase gets a different transform axis (scale+blur slam / side snap / rise+rotate) with short attacks (0.35–0.6s on the hit), then the stack holds with a finite low-amplitude breath.

```js
// ONE tempo grid drives everything — phrases AND the metronome read it.

const BEATS = [PULSE * 1, PULSE * 5, PULSE * 9]; // phrase onsets, on the grid

// Distinct entrances per phrase (NOT one reused helper).

  { y: 90, rotation: 6, opacity: 0 },
  { y: 0, rotation: 0, opacity: 1, duration: 0.55, ease: "circ.out" },

// Rhythm chrome: each tick flashes on the SAME grid, not a magic offset.
gsap.utils.toArray(".kbs-metronome i").forEach((tick, i) => {
  tl.to(tick, { opacity: 1, duration: 0.08, yoyo: true, repeat: 1, ease: "none" }, PULSE * (i + 1));
});

// Finale hold: floor (not ceil) so the repeat never overshoots data-duration;
// max(0,…) so a short hold never yields a negative repeat (GSAP reads negative as -1 = infinite).
const holdStart = BEATS[2] + 0.7,
  cycle = 1.6,
  holdDur = SCENE_DURATION - holdStart;
tl.to(
  ".kbs-stage",

    yoyo: true,
    repeat: Math.max(0, Math.floor(holdDur / cycle) - 1),
  },
  holdStart,
);
```

## Variations

- **Entrance easing by attack character** — `power4.out` hard slam ⭐ default hit · `expo.out` hardest snap (side-snaps, whip-ins) · `back.out(2)` overshoot pop (accents only, not body words) · `circ.out` heavy rise with momentum. Use **at least 3 distinct easings** across the piece.
- **Rhythm chrome alternatives** — a center beat bar or a `// label` monospace tag pulsing on-beat instead of the 5-tick metronome; mark any decorative that must survive a shader transition per `../transitions/overview.md`.
- **Finale dressing** — stack + accent underline sweep ([css-marker-patterns](css-marker-patterns.md)); don't just leave the last phrase sitting.

## Critical Constraints

- **One beat array, not scattered offsets** — every element times off `BEATS[]` / `PULSE`; this is the single biggest lever for "rhythmic".
- **Different entrance per phrase** — a reused `punchIn()` for all lines is the flat-but-competent tell. Vary the motion axis, reuse the ease _family_.
- **Finale repeat math**: `repeat: Math.max(0, Math.floor(dur / cycle) - 1)` — `Math.ceil` overshoots `data-duration` and trips the `gsap_repeat_ceil_overshoot` lint rule; a negative repeat is read by GSAP as `-1` (infinite).
- **No banned exit animations between scenes** — in a montage the _transition_ is the exit (`../transitions/overview.md`); only a final scene may fade out.
- **Display font must be embedded** or it silently falls back at render — Anton / Bebas-as-literal are NOT embedded (`Bebas Neue` aliases to League Gothic; verify in `typography.md`).

description: Coordinated shrink-out + spring pop-in morph-like transition between two elements — no SVG path interpolation needed.

# Scale-Swap Transition

Simulates a "morph" between two DOM elements by overlapping exit and entrance scale animations. Lighter weight than [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (which morphs container dimensions — use that for SHAPE changes; this rule is for SAME-shape state swaps) and easier than SVG path interpolation.

At a single trigger, two coordinated tweens fire:

1. **Outgoing**: scale `1.0 → EXIT_SCALE` + opacity `1 → 0`, fast `power2.in` (rushing away).
2. **Incoming**: scale `EXIT_SCALE → 1.0` + opacity `0 → 1`, `back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` (arriving with weight).

A small `OVERLAP` window during which both are mid-tween creates the morph illusion; the incoming sits on top via z-index so the outgoing's fade-tail doesn't bleed through.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- Both cards position: absolute; inset: 0 in one fixed-size wrapper — same
     footprint, same transform-origin: 50% 50%. Incoming starts opacity: 0,
     transform: scale(EXIT_SCALE), z-index above the outgoing. -->
<div class="swap-wrap">
  <div class="card outgoing" id="outgoing">{outgoingIcon} {outgoingLabel}</div>
  <div class="card incoming" id="incoming">
    {incomingIcon} {incomingLabel}
    <div class="sub" id="sub">{incomingSubline}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
// Outgoing: shrink + fade fast
tl.to(
  "#outgoing",
  { scale: EXIT_SCALE, opacity: 0, duration: EXIT_DUR, ease: "power2.in" },
  TRIGGER,
);

// Incoming: pops in with overshoot, starting OVERLAP before the exit finishes
tl.to(
  "#incoming",
  { scale: 1.0, opacity: 1, duration: ENTER_DUR, ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR - OVERLAP,
);

// Inner content reveals AFTER the incoming settles
tl.fromTo(
  "#sub",
  { opacity: 0, y: SUB_REVEAL_Y_PX },
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUB_REVEAL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR + SUB_REVEAL_DELAY,
);
```

## Variations

- **Delayed inner content reveal** — the classic pattern above: morph the container, then reveal inner text once it settles; the 0.2–0.4 s gap lets the eye land on the new shape before reading.
- **Triple swap (3-state cycle)** — chain A→B→C with triggers `TRIGGER_AB` / `TRIGGER_BC`; each transition is its own tween pair, the previous incoming becoming the next outgoing. State-evolution narratives (early → mid → final labels).
- **Color-shift transition (no scale)** — for a flat morph between same-shape states, drop the scale and keep opacity + a brief background hue tween; less dramatic, more product-UI tone.

## Critical Constraints

- **Incoming z-index ABOVE outgoing** — otherwise the outgoing's fade-tail (opacity 0.3–0.5) bleeds through and double-exposes the frame.
- **Both elements share `transform-origin: 50% 50%`** — different origins make the morph read as one thing teleporting elsewhere.
- **Bouncy ease ONLY on the incoming** — outgoing `power2.in`, incoming `back.out`; reversed, the swap feels mechanical.
- **Both cards `position: absolute; inset: 0`** in the same fixed-size wrapper (sized to fit both states; the wrap never resizes).
- **Don't `display: none` the outgoing** after the fade — leave it at `opacity: 0` so layout doesn't reflow.
- **Inner content reveals after the container settles**; **climax dwell ≥ 1 s** after the final state + subline land.
