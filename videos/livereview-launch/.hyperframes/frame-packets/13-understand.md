## Assigned storyboard block

## Frame 13 — Understand

- handoff_in: the Understand node arrives from the five-pillar ring at (1430, 480), node box 260x88 radius 14, scale 1.00, opacity 1, motionless at the cut; it then travels to this frame's section-marker slot. Frames 9-13 each inherit their own node from Frame 8's locked ring — same box, same radius, same colour treatment.

- narrativeRole: Second pillar — the one that speaks to intellectual control, the CTO's real fear from Frame 2.
- scene: "Can an engineer quickly understand what changed?" then the summary deck and issue navigator as evidence.
- voiceover: "Understand turns a diff into something a human can reason about — a summary deck, a filterable issue list, and a quiz before you commit."

This pillar has the richest captured material — three purpose-shot demo clips. Travel down the
generated work as evidence, then pivot to the quiz as the payoff: it is the beat that answers
Frame 2's "rubber-stamping code you never understood".

Adapt: keep transcript-scroll-artifact-reveal's travel-the-work-then-reveal-the-artifact spine; the travel runs across three real demo surfaces instead of one long document, seamed at matched velocity.

Scene 1 (0.0–2.0s): the **Understand** node lifts from its ring position (`card-morph-anchor`); the pillar question sets per-word (`dynamic-content-sequencing`).
Scene 2 (2.0–4.4s): "a summary deck" — the summary-deck surface enters and travels vertically through its slides (`viewport-change`).
Scene 3 (4.4–6.6s): "a filterable issue list" — a cut-the-curve seam at matched velocity into the issue navigator (`cut-catalog.md`); the severity filters read as it settles.
Scene 4 (6.6–9.003s): "a quiz before you commit" — the quiz artifact reveals via `scale-swap-transition`, landing on the "Take the Quiz" state. This is the payoff that answers F02's rubber-stamping fear. Hold still.

## Selected blueprint: transcript-scroll-artifact-reveal

# transcript-scroll-artifact-reveal — Transcript-Scroll Artifact Reveal

**intent**: The frame travels vertically along ONE long content surface — an agent transcript, a running task feed, an analysis document, a story draft — rendered full-bleed on a flat canvas (no device frame, no held mockup), by camera pan or element scroll; the traversal itself is the story ("look how much work happened / how much is here"), until ONE focal interaction — a file-chip click, a quote highlight, a collapsible-row expand — pivots the shot into an artifact/detail reveal: the deliverable behind the work.

**roles served**

- Key_Feature (modes: `pan-to-workspace` · `feed-rush` · `document-to-artifact` · `selection-pivot`): the x-viral AI-product grammar for "the agent did a lot of work → here's the deliverable." The long surface is the EVIDENCE (tool pills, checked progress items, task rows, headings, comps tables, story paragraphs), read at traversal pace; the artifact is the PAYOFF (full workspace with live mockup, spreadsheet with highlighted cells, inline ask-panel, sub-task stack). Reach for it when the feature's proof is the volume/depth of generated work and the beat should cash that in on one interaction — not a held device tour (`device-surface-showcase`), not a cursor-chased workflow (`cursor-ui-demo`).

**duration**: 5–11.8s (feed-rush 5.4s · pan-to-workspace 5.0s · selection-pivot 9.3s · document-to-artifact 11.75s)

**shot structure** One `[long content surface: agent chat transcript / task feed / analysis document / story doc]` sits full-bleed on a `[flat light canvas]` (goldens: warm off-white / cream / beige / plain white — the surface's own background IS the scene background); dark text with small `[accent]` marks (green verb highlights, model-tag pills, check circles, yellow cells). Three acts: TRAVERSE → HINGE → ARTIFACT. Camera discipline is the signature: at most TWO real camera moves in the whole shot, bracketing the hinge; everything else is element motion on a static frame.

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~40–60% of runtime) — establish + vertical traversal (the evidence).** The surface establishes with one small opener — a `[title]` types on / a centered `[title]` shrinks ~50% and glides to the top-left to dock as a fixed header / the frame opens tight on the `[chat panel]` — then the traversal begins: the frame travels DOWN the content (or the content streams UP through the frame), revealing progressive work in reading order: `[prompt → tool pills → checked progress items → typed summary]`, `[tagged task rows → muted tasks → checklist block]`, `[heading → paragraph → comps table → bullets]`, `[title → story paragraphs → dialogue]`. New rows may cascade in (staggered arrival) before the scroll takes over; a typed line may finish under the moving frame. Traversal texture varies by member: one continuous slow pan, a fast continuous feed rush, stepped scrolls decelerating at each stop (speed-blur between stops, content fading at frame edges), or one smooth scroll easing to a stop.
- **Scene 2 (~1–2s) — the hinge: ONE focal interaction.** The traversal settles and a single interaction pivots the shot: a `[file-attachment chip]` spring-pops in below a typed handoff line and a cursor glides in and CLICKS it; a `[sentence/quote]` gets a selection-highlight sweep and a `[tooltip pill]` spring-pops above it for the click; a `[collapsible row]` reaches the frame center and EXPANDS; or the typed `[verifier summary]` completes as the implicit trigger. This is the only interaction in the shot — the cursor (if any) appears here for the first time.
- **Scene 3 (rest) — artifact reveal + hold.** The hinge cashes in, choosing ONE reveal mechanic: a fast smoothly-DECELERATING zoom-OUT re-frames the whole `[workspace]` (the panel just traversed becomes a sidebar beside a `[live mockup]` and `[tool panel]`); an `[artifact window: spreadsheet]` scales up from small toward full frame, then a slow push-in + lateral pan settles on its `[highlighted cells]`; an `[inline panel]` expands below the highlighted line and a `[follow-up question]` types into it; or the row unfolds into a `[sub-task stack]` and the scroll settles on `[narration text]`. Optional coda: one cursor click instantly swaps a `[screen]` inside the revealed artifact (e.g. a phone tab click). Frame locks; element motion only to the end.

- Variant — _pan-to-workspace_ (001_claudeai, 5.0s): traversal is a REAL camera pan — opens tight on the chat panel, one single uninterrupted downward glide (never cutting away) over pills → checked list → typing verifier summary; hinge is the summary completing; reveal is ONE rapid decelerating zoom-out to the three-part workspace (chat-as-sidebar / phone mockup / tweaks panel); coda cursor click swaps the phone screen instantly. Exactly two camera moves total.
- Variant — _feed-rush_ (010_perplexity A, 5.4s): NO camera at all — title docks to header, five tagged rows cascade in, then a fast continuous upward ELEMENT scroll races through muted tasks and a checklist to a collapsible row; hinge is the row itself; reveal is the row expanding into a six-item sub-task stack, settling on narration. Cursorless.
- Variant — _document-to-artifact_ (010_perplexity B, 11.75s): traversal is a stepped ELEMENT scroll (static frame) — the document climbs in fast steps, decelerating at each stop, blur/fade between stops, clearing to blank canvas; hinge is a typed handoff line + file-chip pop + cursor click; reveal is the spreadsheet window scaling up then one slow continuous push-in + rightward pan onto the yellow-highlighted forecast columns.
- Variant — _selection-pivot_ (014_OpenAI, 9.3s): typed headline → document builds (bubble prompt + typed title + populating paragraphs) → one smooth upward element scroll eases to a stop; hinge is the selection-highlight sweep + the shot's ONE push-in framing the sentence + tooltip-pill click; reveal is the inline panel expanding below the line with the referenced quote and a rapidly-typed follow-up question. Camera locked at the pushed-in zoom to the end.

**motion vocabulary** continuous slow downward camera pan; fast continuous upward feed scroll; stepped document scroll decelerating at each stop; smooth scroll easing to a stop; speed-blur between scroll stops; content fade at frame edges; centered title shrinks ~50% and glides to a top-left header dock; task rows cascade in staggered; typed line / typed title / typed follow-up question (caret); green leading-verb highlights and model-tag pills riding past; checked-item strikethroughs riding past; file-attachment chip spring pop-in; tooltip pill spring pop; chat-bubble arrival; cursor glide-in + click; selection-highlight sweep across a sentence; ONE camera push-in onto the selection; fast decelerating zoom-out to the full workspace; artifact window scales up from small; slow push-in + lateral pan settling on highlighted cells; collapsible row expands into a sub-task stack; inline panel expands below the line; phone-screen instant swap on a coda tab click; frame-lock hold.

**rule mapping**

- vertical traversal by ELEMENT scroll — fast feed rush / stepped document scroll / smooth scroll-to-stop → `3d-page-scroll` (flat variant: tilt ≈ 0 — the surface's content `translateY`-scrolls to sections; the multi-phase scroll variant covers stepped stops; keep ONE ease family across all steps — `power3.out`/`power4.out` for UI-scroll feel)
- vertical traversal by CAMERA pan (transcript glide) → `viewport-change` (pan mode — the world translates up under a static frame; one continuous tween, no cuts)
- speed-blur between stepped-scroll stops → `motion-blur-streak` (blur peaks at max scroll velocity, resolves to 0 at each settle)
- which content each traversal beat reveals (stop-by-stop sequencing) → `dynamic-content-sequencing`
- centered title shrinks and glides to dock as a fixed header → `gsap-effects` (one simultaneous scale + translate tween; plain two-property move, no named rule required)
- task rows cascade in staggered before the scroll takes over → `waterfall-entry` (arrival cascade; goldens use fade + slide-up — the house rule prescribes binary-opacity whip-in, adopt the house form) or `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered group) for card-like rows
- typed lines — verifier summary, handoff line, document title, follow-up question, opening headline → `discrete-text-sequence` (+ `context-sensitive-cursor` for the trailing caret)
- file-attachment chip pop-in / tooltip pill pop / chat-bubble arrival → `spring-pop-entrance`
- cursor glides in, lands, clicks (hinge and coda) → `cursor-click-ripple` (+ `physics-press-reaction` to compress cursor and target together on the press)
- selection-highlight sweep across the sentence → `css-marker-patterns` (highlight sweep)
- ONE push-in onto the highlighted selection / slow push-in + lateral pan settling on highlighted cells → `coordinate-target-zoom` (measured off-center target — the lateral pan IS the counter-translate component), sequenced under `multi-phase-camera` when it follows the window scale-up
- fast decelerating zoom-OUT to the full workspace → `coordinate-target-zoom` (zoom-out variation: open at the zoomed-in framing, pull to scale 1 with `power3.out`/`power4.out`) or `viewport-change` (single continuous pull on the `cam` object)
- artifact window scales up from small toward full frame on the click → `spring-pop-entrance` (hero arrival scale-up; tune overshoot to ~0 / `power3.out` so the window reads weighty, not bouncy)
- collapsible row expands into a sub-task stack / inline panel expands below the highlighted line → `anchored-layout-expand` (in-flow accordion growth pushing subsequent content DOWN — never tween width/height) + `waterfall-entry` (or `spring-pop-entrance` stagger) on the arriving children
- phone-screen instant swap on the coda tab click → `discrete-text-sequence` (discrete whole-state swap; instant, no in-artifact camera move)
- green verb highlights, model-tag pills, check-circle strikethroughs, yellow forecast cells, edge fade masks → static styling of the surface content — no motion rule needed

**camera modifier**: The blueprint's camera law: **at most TWO real camera moves, bracketing the hinge** — the goldens are emphatic (their briefs carry CRITICAL camera notes). Pick the traversal mechanic first: camera pan (`viewport-change` pan — pan-to-workspace only) OR element scroll (`3d-page-scroll` flat — all others); never both at once. The reveal then spends the second (or only) move: one zoom-OUT to the workspace or one push-IN to the detail (`coordinate-target-zoom`, phases sequenced by `multi-phase-camera`), after which the frame LOCKS — all remaining motion is element-level (typing, expand, screen swap). The feed-rush variant spends zero camera moves: the whole shot is element scroll + expand. This restraint is what separates the shape from `cursor-ui-demo` (camera servos to every interaction) and from `device-surface-showcase` (a showcase camera presenting a held hero).

**Overflow (scrolled/panned surfaces — required for a clean `check`):** the traversal deliberately moves content past the frame edges. Clip at the scene (`overflow: hidden`) AND mark the moving inner layer (the `.page-content` / `.world` wrapper carrying the transcript/feed/document) with `data-layout-allow-overflow` — otherwise `check` reports `text_box_overflow` / `container_overflow` for every row that has scrolled off. The clip handles it visually; the attribute tells the layout audit it's intentional.

# Card Morph Anchor

A free-floating container morphs apparent size, corner radius, and surface treatment between two shots — the morph itself IS the transition; the viewer's eye tracks the persistent container. Distinct from [anchored-layout-expand.md](anchored-layout-expand.md) (an edge-pinned live layout participant that grows along one axis and reflows neighbors — here nothing is pushed) and [theme-crossfade-morph.md](theme-crossfade-morph.md) (a whole-theme reskin under a fixed anchor — here a single container changes shape).

## How It Works

Since `width`/`height` tweens are forbidden, **substitute uniform `scale` for apparent size**; the remaining morph channels are **paint-only**: `borderRadius`, `background`, `boxShadow`. All channels ride ONE tween (one ease, one duration) so the shape morphs in lockstep. Content choreography: old content fades out during the first ~40% of the morph, new content fades in during the last ~40% — the shape-only gap between is the natural "blink." Optionally the morph card itself fades at the very end, revealing the real next-shot element rendered behind it.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<!-- DOM order = stacking: the anchor renders BEFORE the card, so the card is on top -->
<div class="next-shot-anchor"><img src="{nextShotAnchor}" alt="anchor" /></div>
<div class="morph-card">
  <div class="content-old">{shotOneContent}</div>
  <div class="content-new">{shotTwoContent}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.morph-card {
  width: SHOT_ONE_W;
  height: SHOT_ONE_H; /* shot-1 geometry; the morph is scale, never width/height */
  border-radius: SHOT_ONE_RADIUS;
  background: {surfaceShotOne};
  overflow: hidden; /* content must clip during the shape change */
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  will-change: transform;
}
.content-old,
.content-new {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
.content-new {
  opacity: 0; /* author its inner sizes at apparent-size ÷ END_SCALE — it scales with the card */
}
.next-shot-anchor {
  position: absolute;
  opacity: 0; /* fades in as the morph card fades out */
}
```

```js
const END_SCALE = SHOT_TWO_W / SHOT_ONE_W; // uniform — keep the two shots aspect-matched

// Hold shot 1 for HOLD_BEAT first — an instant morph reads as glitchy.

// One tween, all channels: uniform scale + paint-only properties.
tl.to(
  ".morph-card",
  {
    scale: END_SCALE,
    borderRadius: SHOT_TWO_RADIUS / END_SCALE, // borderRadius is pre-scale — divide to land the APPARENT radius
    background: "{surfaceShotTwo}",
    boxShadow: "{shadowShotTwo}",
    duration: MORPH_DUR,
    ease: "power2.inOut",
  },
  MORPH_START,
);

tl.to(
  ".content-old",
  { opacity: 0, duration: MORPH_DUR * OLD_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.in" },
  MORPH_START,
);
tl.to(
  ".content-new",
  { opacity: 1, duration: MORPH_DUR * NEW_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.out" },
  MORPH_START + MORPH_DUR * (1 - NEW_FADE_FRAC),
);

// Optional handoff — card fades out over the pixel-identical real anchor.
tl.to(
  ".morph-card",
  { opacity: 0, duration: MORPH_DUR * FINAL_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.in", immediateRender: false },
  MORPH_START + MORPH_DUR * (1 - FINAL_FADE_FRAC),
);
tl.to(
  ".next-shot-anchor",
  { opacity: 1, duration: MORPH_DUR * FINAL_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.out" },
  MORPH_START + MORPH_DUR * (1 - FINAL_FADE_FRAC),
);
```

## Morph channels

| channel        | how                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| apparent size  | uniform `scale` — the substitution for the forbidden `width`/`height` tween; aspect preserved  |
| `borderRadius` | paint-only; pre-scale units — tween to `APPARENT_RADIUS / END_SCALE`, ≤ half the smaller side  |
| `background`   | paint-only; gradients interpolate only with equal stop counts (solid→solid: `backgroundColor`) |
| `boxShadow`    | paint-only; base shadow → accent glow shifts emphasis                                          |

## Variations

- **Landing on a non-centered target** (dock icon, sidebar slot): add `x`/`y` to the same tween, computed as the FLIP-style delta between the card's and the target's rects — `getBoundingClientRect()` both at build time (single-scene only, per the contract) and tween the difference. Don't hand-compute from CSS values: paddings, borders, and parent transforms compound, and center-vs-edge arithmetic is the classic off-by-half bug.
- **Aspect change between shots**: uniform scale preserves aspect — morph to the nearest uniform fit and let the crossfade/handoff absorb the small delta, or drop the handoff and hold the card's final state.

## Values

| token             | range                     | notes                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| HOLD_BEAT         | 0.6–1.5s                  | ≥ shot 1's entry settle; the viewer must register shot 1 first                       |
| MORPH_DUR         | 0.6–1.2s                  | < 0.5s can't fit both content fades                                                  |
| END_SCALE         | SHOT_TWO_W / SHOT_ONE_W   | icon-sized handoffs typically land at 80–400px apparent width                        |
| SHOT_TWO_RADIUS   | ≤ min(W, H)/2 apparent    | half the smaller side = perfect circle; beyond is clamped                            |
| OLD/NEW_FADE_FRAC | 0.3–0.5 each, sum ≤ 1     | the gap between is the shape-only "blink"                                            |
| FINAL_FADE_FRAC   | 0 (no handoff) or 0.1–0.2 | only when a pixel-identical anchor exists                                            |
| ease              | `power2.inOut` canonical  | `power3`/`expo.inOut` OK; never `back`/`elastic` — overshoot fights the shape change |

## Critical Constraints

- **❗ Uniform-scale substitution** — never tween `width`/`height`; `scale` + the paint-only channels (`borderRadius`, `background`, `boxShadow`) are the ONLY morph properties.
- **❗ Handoff anchor must be pixel-identical to the card's final state** — same apparent size, radius, background, shadow, inner icon dimensions. Any delta = a visible pop during the crossfade. Can't match exactly? Drop the handoff and hold the morph card.
- **❗ Stacking by DOM order, never a z-index snap mid-fade** — render the anchor before the card; a `tl.set({ zIndex })` during an active opacity tween flips stacking before the fade finishes and flickers.
- **`overflow: hidden`** on the card — content must clip as the radius changes.
- **Hold a beat before morphing**; same ease family for shape and crossfade (mixed eases read unsynchronized).

## Selected motion rule: dynamic-content-sequencing

name: dynamic-content-sequencing
description: Auto-calculate timeline start/end times from content length + per-item duration config — longer content gets more screen time without hardcoded numbers.
metadata:

# Dynamic Content Sequencing

A utility pattern (not a motion rule in itself) for scenes that show a SEQUENCE of items (cards, phrases, stats): each item's duration is computed from its content length + per-item config, and the sequencer assigns absolute start/end times automatically — no hardcoded offsets per item. Distinct from [discrete-text-sequence](discrete-text-sequence.md) (one text element changing states) — this rule swaps between distinct content blocks.

## How It Works

A content array of `{ eyebrow, title, body, speedFactor, hold }` entries is reduced once at build time into a flat `TIMELINE` of `{ …entry, start, end }` — duration per entry is `BASE_DURATION + body.length × SEC_PER_CHAR + hold`, so longer text earns more reading time. A single linear driver's `onUpdate` reverse-searches the active entry and swaps the DOM **only on transitions** (a `lastTitle` guard — per-frame `textContent` writes flicker in render); an optional progress bar fills 0→100% across the whole run.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="display">
  <div class="eyebrow" id="eyebrow"></div>
  <div class="title" id="title"></div>
  <div class="body" id="body"></div>
  <div class="progress-bar"><div class="progress-fill" id="progress-fill"></div></div>
</div>
```

```css
.body {
  min-height: 160px; /* reserve space — content height varies; without this, layout jumps */
}
.progress-fill {
  height: 100%;
  width: 0%;
}
```

```js
// N entries, each with its own pacing (optionally a speedFactor multiplier);
// the final entry uses a larger hold (closing beat).
const CONTENT = [
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrow1}", title: "{title1}", body: "{body1}", hold: HOLD_MID },
  // …
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrowN}", title: "{titleN}", body: "{bodyN}", hold: HOLD_FINAL },
];

// Pre-compute absolute start/end ONCE — never in onUpdate.
let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry) => {
  const dur = BASE_DURATION + entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR + entry.hold;
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});

function entryAt(time) {
  for (let i = TIMELINE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= TIMELINE[i].start) return TIMELINE[i];
  }
  return TIMELINE[0];
}

const eyebrowEl = document.getElementById("eyebrow");
const titleEl = document.getElementById("title");
const bodyEl = document.getElementById("body");
const progressEl = document.getElementById("progress-fill");

const TOTAL_DURATION = cumulative + TAIL_PAD;
const driver = { t: 0 };
let lastTitle = "";

tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const entry = entryAt(driver.t);
      // Swap content only on transitions — no per-frame DOM thrash
      if (entry.title !== lastTitle) {
        eyebrowEl.textContent = entry.eyebrow;
        titleEl.textContent = entry.title;
        bodyEl.textContent = entry.body;
        lastTitle = entry.title;
      }
      progressEl.style.width = `${(driver.t / TOTAL_DURATION) * 100}%`;
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Crossfade between items** — return BOTH adjacent entries during an overlap window (`time ≥ e.start − overlap && time ≤ e.end + overlap`, overlap ≈ 0.3s) and render them with opacities computed from distance to the boundary.
- **Per-item motion variation** — map an `entry.style` key to an existing rule per chapter (e.g. `3d-text-depth-layers` → `hacker-flip-3d` → `counting-dynamic-scale`); the sequencer only orchestrates timing.
- **Auto-extend composition duration** — you can set `data-duration` from the computed `TOTAL_DURATION` in script, but HF reads `data-duration` at composition load and setting it after init may not take effect — author the duration manually from a rough total.

### Accelerating cadence (geometric hold decay)

For rhetorical escalation — "everyone says…", a roll-call, a praise flurry — the beat grid itself accelerates: early entries hold ~1s (read speed), then windows shrink geometrically into a ~0.15–0.3s flurry, braking on an emphasis state before the resolve. The acceleration is pre-computed into the same flat `TIMELINE` — still content-driven, still deterministic, no speed-up tween anywhere:

```js
// Geometric decay on the hold, clamped at a flurry floor; the brake state holds longest.
const HOLDS = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => Math.max(FLURRY_FLOOR, HOLD_START * Math.pow(DECAY, i)));
HOLDS[CONTENT.length - 1] = HOLD_FINAL;

let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => {
  // Past ~0.5s states are glanced as motion texture, not read —
  // drop the per-char term or you never reach flurry speed.
  const readable = HOLDS[i] >= READ_THRESHOLD;
  const dur = HOLDS[i] + (readable ? entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR : 0);
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});
```

Worked example — **praise-chip flurry**: ~16 short quotes hard-cut through a chip beside a pinned wordmark. First 3 states at `HOLD_START = 1.0` (each reads fully); `DECAY = 0.8` shrinks every following window until `FLURRY_FLOOR = 0.2` catches it (≈12 states over ~2.5s — a churn of acclaim, individually glanced); the longest phrase takes `HOLD_FINAL ≈ 1.6` as the brake before the closing lockup.

Values: `HOLD_START` 0.8–1.2s; `DECAY` 0.75–0.88 (higher = longer runway before the flurry bites); `FLURRY_FLOOR` 0.15–0.3s (below ~0.15s swaps strobe); `READ_THRESHOLD` ~0.5s; brake ≥ 4× the floor or the stop doesn't register as a beat. The 3–6 entry guidance relaxes here — 12–18 states are legal precisely because flurry states aren't individually read. The hard-cut discipline (`lastTitle` guard, instant swaps) is what lets 0.2s states render clean.

## Critical Constraints

- **Pre-compute the TIMELINE once at build** — never recompute in `onUpdate`; the reverse search over the flat array is the whole per-frame cost.
- **DOM swap only on entry transition** (`lastTitle`/key guard) — per-frame `textContent` assignment flickers in HF render.
- **`min-height` on the body element** — without reservation, downstream elements (progress bar, brand) jitter as content height varies.
- **Sequential only** — for parallel tracks use a different reduction.
- **Titles fit one line at the chosen size; bodies fit inside `min-height` after wrapping.**

# Scale-Swap Transition

Simulates a "morph" between two DOM elements by overlapping exit and entrance scale animations. Lighter weight than [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (which morphs container dimensions — use that for SHAPE changes; this rule is for SAME-shape state swaps) and easier than SVG path interpolation.

At a single trigger, two coordinated tweens fire:

1. **Outgoing**: scale `1.0 → EXIT_SCALE` + opacity `1 → 0`, fast `power2.in` (rushing away).
2. **Incoming**: scale `EXIT_SCALE → 1.0` + opacity `0 → 1`, `back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` (arriving with weight).

A small `OVERLAP` window during which both are mid-tween creates the morph illusion; the incoming sits on top via z-index so the outgoing's fade-tail doesn't bleed through.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- Both cards position: absolute; inset: 0 in one fixed-size wrapper — same
     footprint, same transform-origin: 50% 50%. Incoming starts opacity: 0,
     transform: scale(EXIT_SCALE), z-index above the outgoing. -->
<div class="swap-wrap">
  <div class="card outgoing" id="outgoing">{outgoingIcon} {outgoingLabel}</div>
  <div class="card incoming" id="incoming">
    {incomingIcon} {incomingLabel}
    <div class="sub" id="sub">{incomingSubline}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
// Outgoing: shrink + fade fast
tl.to(
  "#outgoing",
  { scale: EXIT_SCALE, opacity: 0, duration: EXIT_DUR, ease: "power2.in" },
  TRIGGER,
);

// Incoming: pops in with overshoot, starting OVERLAP before the exit finishes
tl.to(
  "#incoming",
  { scale: 1.0, opacity: 1, duration: ENTER_DUR, ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR - OVERLAP,
);

// Inner content reveals AFTER the incoming settles
tl.fromTo(
  "#sub",
  { opacity: 0, y: SUB_REVEAL_Y_PX },
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUB_REVEAL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR + SUB_REVEAL_DELAY,
);
```

## Variations

- **Delayed inner content reveal** — the classic pattern above: morph the container, then reveal inner text once it settles; the 0.2–0.4 s gap lets the eye land on the new shape before reading.
- **Triple swap (3-state cycle)** — chain A→B→C with triggers `TRIGGER_AB` / `TRIGGER_BC`; each transition is its own tween pair, the previous incoming becoming the next outgoing. State-evolution narratives (early → mid → final labels).
- **Color-shift transition (no scale)** — for a flat morph between same-shape states, drop the scale and keep opacity + a brief background hue tween; less dramatic, more product-UI tone.

## Critical Constraints

- **Incoming z-index ABOVE outgoing** — otherwise the outgoing's fade-tail (opacity 0.3–0.5) bleeds through and double-exposes the frame.
- **Both elements share `transform-origin: 50% 50%`** — different origins make the morph read as one thing teleporting elsewhere.
- **Bouncy ease ONLY on the incoming** — outgoing `power2.in`, incoming `back.out`; reversed, the swap feels mechanical.
- **Both cards `position: absolute; inset: 0`** in the same fixed-size wrapper (sized to fit both states; the wrap never resizes).
- **Don't `display: none` the outgoing** after the fade — leave it at `opacity: 0` so layout doesn't reflow.
- **Inner content reveals after the container settles**; **climax dwell ≥ 1 s** after the final state + subline land.

# Viewport Change (Virtual Camera)

Simulates camera effects (zoom / pan / focus-lock on a moving element) by transforming a wrapper around ALL scene content. The "world" moves opposite to the perceived camera. Distinct from [multi-phase-camera](multi-phase-camera.md) (2-3 discrete phases + drift) — viewport-change is a single continuous zoom/pan, often used for focus-lock following a moving element.

## How It Works

Camera intent → world transform. Camera **pans right** → world `translateX(-distance)`; camera **zooms in** → world `scale(>1)`; camera **follows element X** → world `translateX(viewportCenter - elementWorldX)` per-frame. Get the sign right or everything moves the wrong way. The single `.world` wrapper holds the camera transform; elements inside are positioned in world space, unchanged.

**Single-element composite transform (this rule's form).** Both scale and translate live on ONE wrapper as `translate(x, y) scale(S)`. CSS applies scale FIRST, then translate (right-to-left matrix composition), so a point at world offset `(ox, oy)` lands on screen at `(S × ox + x, S × oy + y)`. To map the target to viewport center, solve `S × offset + T = 0`:

```
T = -offset × S
```

This is **different from [coordinate-target-zoom](coordinate-target-zoom.md)**, which uses two nested wrappers (outer scales, inner translates) and derives `T = -offset` (independent of S). Mixing up the two forms drifts the target off-center as scale changes. Use this single-wrapper form when you want one source of truth for camera state (`cam.scale`, `cam.x`, `cam.y`) written via `onUpdate`; use nested wrappers when scale and translate can tween independently with shared ease.

## Recipe

```html
<div class="world" id="world">
  <div class="content">
    <div class="hero">{Brand}</div>
    <div class="tagline">{tagline}</div>
    <div class="cta" id="cta">{ctaUrl}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.scene {
  overflow: hidden; /* REQUIRED — any non-1.0 scale reveals edges or pushes content off-frame */
  background: {bgGradient}; /* on .scene, NOT .world — a world-borne background warps with the camera */
}
.world {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* centered scaling is what the math assumes */
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
const world = document.getElementById("world");

// Camera state — single source of truth. The world transform is composed from
// this object in ONE place so the transform string order is stable.
const cam = { scale: 1, x: 0, y: 0 };
function applyCamera() {
  world.style.transform = `translate(${cam.x}px, ${cam.y}px) scale(${cam.scale})`;
}
applyCamera(); // seed frame 0

// Zoom in on the CTA: single-element composite transform → T = -offset × S.
// TARGET_OFFSET_Y is the target's measured offset from viewport center at
// neutral camera (sign matters — positive = below center).
const counterY = -TARGET_OFFSET_Y * TARGET_SCALE;

tl.to(
  cam,
  {
    scale: TARGET_SCALE,
    y: counterY,
    duration: ZOOM_DUR,
    ease: "power3.inOut",
    onUpdate: applyCamera,
  },
  ZOOM_START,
);
```

## Scale Value Guide

| Effect      | Scale       | Feel                                |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Subtle      | 1.02 - 1.05 | Barely perceptible — "professional" |
| Medium      | 1.05 - 1.15 | "Ta-da" emphasis                    |
| Noticeable  | 1.15 - 1.30 | Focus on region                     |
| Dramatic    | 1.5 - 2.5   | Element fills screen                |
| Full-screen | 3.0+        | Element covers viewport             |

Perception: < 5% scale change is imperceptible; 10-15% is comfortable emphasis; > 30% is cinematic/dramatic. For a natural product feel, prefer 1.05-1.15× over 2-3s; save big > 1.3× zooms for dramatic narrative moments.

### Extreme range — 4–12× outward (workspace reveal)

The same single-cam math runs far past the table: a zoom-out workspace reveal opens punched-in at **4–12×** on one detail (a single cell, message, or button) and pulls out to the full workspace in one continuous move. The mechanics don't change — one `cam` object, `T = -offset × S`, one `applyCamera()` writer — only the authoring direction does:

- **Build the workspace at its final (1×) layout and OPEN scaled-in** (`cam.scale = 8`, counter-translate aiming the opening detail; state it in a `fromTo` / seed via `applyCamera()` so a seek to t=0 lands punched-in). The wide landing frame is then everything at native design size — text crisp, raster assets at source resolution.
- **Never the inverse** — authoring the close-up at 1× and scaling the world down to 0.08–0.25 for the wide frame drops every label below legible pixel size and softens raster media; the reveal lands on mush.
- **Measure the opening target** — at S = 8, a 1 px error in the baked offset is 8 px on screen at the opening pose. Take the offset from the target's real laid-out center (`getBoundingClientRect` after `fonts.ready`, once at setup — the measuring doctrine in [coordinate-target-zoom.md](coordinate-target-zoom.md)), never from a layout formula.
- **The opening detail must survive ×S** — it renders at `S ×` its design size on the first frames (vector/DOM text is safe; raster needs `sourceResolution ≥ rendered × S`).

## Variations

- **Focus-lock (camera follows a moving cursor/character)** — keep the element at a fixed screen X by computing the world offset per-frame inside the driver's `onUpdate`:

```js
const focusEl = document.querySelector(".moving-cursor");
const targetScreenX = VIEWPORT_WIDTH * FOCUS_SCREEN_X_FRAC; // 0.4–0.7; 0.5 = dead center
const focusUpdate = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  focusUpdate,
  {
    p: 1,
    duration: FOLLOW_DUR, // matches how long the focused element is in motion
    ease: "power2.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const rect = focusEl.getBoundingClientRect();
      cam.x = targetScreenX - (rect.left + rect.width / 2);
      applyCamera();
    },
  },
  FOLLOW_START,
);
```

- **Composite scale (multi-phase)** — two proxy tweens multiplied through one writer: `cam.scale = scaleUp.v * scaleDown.v; applyCamera()`. Combine a slow push-in (~1.15) with a brief release (~0.9) for a breath/punch shape.
- **Camera mode transition (centered → follow)** — crossfade two camera modes via a 0→1 weight tween; intermediate frames interpolate between the modes' offsets.

## Critical Constraints

- **One `.world` wrapper carries the whole camera** — every scene element lives inside it; a second transformed wrapper is a second camera.
- **Single source of truth via the `cam` object + `applyCamera()`** — when scale and translate both change, write them in ONE place; never split them across tweens that touch `world.style.transform` directly (the transform string composition order becomes unpredictable).
- **Single-wrapper counter-translate is `T = -offset × S`** — don't import the nested-wrapper `T = -offset` formula.
- **`overflow: hidden` on `.scene`**; **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on `.world`**; **background on `.scene`, never on `.world`**.
